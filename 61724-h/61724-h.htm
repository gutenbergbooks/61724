<p lang ="fr">“Mathnaoui ou Methnevi (in Persian and Turkish: <i>Mesnevī</i>). C’est le nom
d’un des plus fameux Livres de l’Orient, composé en vers Persiens sur un grand
nombre de différentes matières de Religion, d’Histoire, de Morale, et de Politique.</p>

<p lang ="fr">“Il a été composé par Gelaleddin Mohammed, fils de Mohammed, Al Balkhi,
Al Konoui, environ l’an 600 de l’Hegire.</p>

<p lang ="fr">“Les surnoms de Balkhi et de Konoui sont donnés à cet Auteur, parce qu’il
était natif de la ville de Balkh en Khorassan, et qu’il vint s’établir ensuite dans
celle de Cogni en Natolie.</p>

<p lang ="fr">“Ce fut dans cette même ville qu’il institua un ordre de Derviches plus
spirituels que les autres, lesquels on appelle ordinairement Mevlevis, qui font
leur Capital de l’ouvrage de leur Maistre, auquel ils ne portent guères moins de
respect qu’ à l’Alcoran. C’est pourquoi on donne aussi souvent au Mathnaoui le
surnom de Mevlevi.</p>

<h2 id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h2>


<p>The historian El Eflākī was a disciple of Chelebī Emīr
‘Ārif, a grandson of the author of the Mesnevī. ‘Ārif died
in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1320; but as the dates of ‘Ārif’s successors are
carried down to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 754 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1353), when Eflākī’s collection
of anecdotes was completed, the historian must have
outlived this last date. As a disciple of the Emīr ‘Ārif, he
was a dervish of the order named Mevlevī, as being followers
of the rule and practices of Mevlānā Jelālu-’d-Dīn,
er-Rūmī, commonly known in English literature as “the
dancing dervishes,” expressed by Americans: “whirling
dervishes.” The dervishes of the order do not all dance
or “whirl.” Some are musicians, and some singers or
chanters, who may, however, be occasional dancers also.</p>

<p>Eflākī’s work gives a sufficiency of dates to fix the
principal events that he commemorates. His dates do
not agree exactly with those found in other historians.
They are, however, sufficiently near for general purposes
not of a chronologically critical nature. They commence
with <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 605 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1208), and thus cover a period of 145
years dated, besides another 30 years of the lifetime of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Jelāl’s grandfather undated, who was a noble of such
high standing and of so great a reputation for learning
and sanctity at Balkh, that the king gave him his only
daughter in marriage, unsolicited. His mother was also
a princess of the same royal house with his wife.</p>

<p>This royal house was the one known in history as that
of <i>Kh’ārezm-shāh</i> or the Kharezmians. They were overthrown,
and Balkh (the ancient Bactra, or Zariaspa), their
capital, destroyed, by Jengīz Khān in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1211. A remnant
of their kingdom was continued for twelve years
longer by the last of the line, who died, at once a fugitive
and an invader, in Azerbāyjān, in a battle fought against
the combined forces of Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Jelāl’s family claimed descent from Abū-Bekr, a father-in-law
and the first successor of Muhammed, the lawgiver
of Islām. One of the descendants of Abū-Bekr was among
the conquerors of the ancient Bactria, when it was first
brought under Muslim rule, in about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 650, under the
Caliph ‘Ūthmān; and his children had maintained a prominent
position in that country, possessed of great wealth,
until the time immediately preceding the irruption of
Jengīz.</p>

<p>Jelāl was the youngest of three children, two being
sons, born of the princess, his mother, in Balkh. The
eldest, a daughter, was already married, and remained
behind with her husband, when her father and brothers
left their native city some time between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1208 and
1211, in which latter year they were at Bagdād. There
is no further mention of Jelāl’s elder brother. Jelāl was
five years old when they left Balkh. By way of Bagdād
they went to Mekka, thence to Damascus, and next to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
Erzinjān, in Armenia; thence to Larenda, in Asia Minor.
Jelāl’s mother was still with the party. He was now
eighteen years old; and was married, at Larenda, to a
lady named Gevher (Pearl), daughter of a certain Lala
Sherefu-’d-Dīn of Samarqand, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1226.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> She bore
him two sons there, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn (afterwards killed in a
tumult at Qonya) and Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Sultān Veled, through
whom the succession of the house was continued. She
appears to have died rather young; for Jelāl afterwards
married another lady of Qonya, who outlived him, and by
whom he had two other children, a son and a daughter.
(See Anecdotes, Chap, iii., No. 69, for a variant.)</p>

<p>After the birth of Sultān Veled at Larenda, Jelāl’s
father was invited to Qonya by the Seljūqi king, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn
Kayqubād, where he founded a college, and where
he died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1231. The king built a marble mausoleum
over his grave, with this date inscribed on it. The
king himself died, five years later, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1236.</p>

<p>At his father’s death, Jelāl went to Aleppo and Damascus
for several years to study, and then returned to Qonya,
where he was appointed professor of four separate colleges.
His reputation for learning and sanctity became very
great.</p>

<p>But before this journey to Damascus, he appears to
have paid a visit to Larenda. For, a former pupil of
his father’s at Balkh, who had become a great saint and
anchoret, came to Qonya to seek Jelāl, and was the cause
of his returning from Larenda to the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>This was the Sheykh and Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīnn, who
became Jelāl’s spiritual teacher for some time. The dates
given do not agree in the various branches of Eflākī’s
compilation; for he here gives a period of nine years’
spiritual study at Qonya under Burhān.</p>

<p>After Burhān’s instructions and departure from Qonya
to Qaysariyya, where he died, and after Jelāl’s studies
at Aleppo and Damascus, with his subsequent return to
Qonya and appointment to the four colleges, another
great saint came to visit Jelāl at this latter city. This
was Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz, for whom Jelāl conceived
a very great friendship. He is mentioned in the Mesnevī
several times in very high terms. He appears to have
been exceedingly aggressive and domineering in his manner.
This roused a fierce animosity against him, which
at length broke out in a tumult. Jelāl’s eldest son, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn,
was killed or mortally hurt in this disturbance.
The local police seized Shemsu-’d-Dīn in consequence,
and he was never again seen alive by his friends. Jelāl
went himself to Damascus, in hopes that he might have
been sent away, or have got away, privately. But the
effort was fruitless. Later traditions cause his corpse to
have been recovered and buried at Qonya, differing, however,
as to the place of interment.</p>

<p>When Jelāl found that he required assistance in conducting
all the various duties that fell on him, he selected
first for that office his former fellow-student-, Sheykh
Salāhu-’d-Dīn Ferīdūn, surnamed Zer-Kūb (the Goldbeater),
from his business. He assisted Jelāl for about
ten years, and died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1258.</p>

<p>Jelāl now took as his assistant his own favourite pupil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
Hasan Husāmu-’d-Dīn, surnamed the son of Akhī-Turk,
through his being descended from some man of celebrity of
the name or designation of Akhī-Turk. There appears
to have been a large family of very influential men residing
at Qonya and other towns of Asia Minor, all calling
themselves Akhī, and distinguished as Akhī Ahmed,
Akhī Eshref, &amp;c. The word “Akhī” is Arabic, and
signifies “my brother.” It may also mean “one related
to a brother,” as a servant, slave, client, &amp;c., of some
prince, &amp;c.; or of some dervish “brother” of some
religious order. Indeed, these very numerous individuals
named Akhī, may have been each a “brother” of such
a fraternity or fraternities, or even of some industrial
guild.</p>

<p>Ten years after Husām was taken as his assistant by Jelāl,
this latter was called to his rest in December <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1273;
and was buried in his father’s mausoleum, leaving Husām
as his successor. But meanwhile, at Husām’s suggestion,
and with himself as the first amanuensis thereof, the
Mesnevī had been composed, in six volumes, books, or parts,
by Jelāl. The second volume was commenced in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1263.
There had been an interval of two years between the
completion of the first and this, caused by Husām’s
grief at the death of his wife. The whole work is stated
to contain twenty-six thousand six hundred and sixty
couplets. A seventh volume or book has been also attributed
to the Mesnevī, to make up the number to that of
the “seven planets;” some say it was composed or
collected by Sultān Veled. The anecdotes of Eflākī
make mention of many hundreds of odes composed also
by Jelāl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span></p>

<p>He is said to have instituted his peculiar order of
dervishes, with their special dress, the Indian garb of
mourning, in memory of his murdered friend, Shemsu-’d-Dīn
of Tebrīz; and to have adopted the use of instrumental
music, the flute, the rebeck, the drum, and the
tambourine, with singing or chanting, as an accompaniment
to the holy dance, on account of the lethargic nature
of the “Romans.” As a child is tempted to take a salutary
medicine by the exhibition of a little jam or honey, so
Jelāl judged that the “Romans” might be tempted to a
devotional love for God through the bait of sweet sounds
addressed to their outward senses. Dancing or twirling
by dervishes was of much older date, as will be recollected
in one of the tales of the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Husām died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1284, just ten years after his teacher
Jelāl; whose son, Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, Sultān Veled, succeeded
Husām as chief of the order, and died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1312. His
son, Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif, succeeded him, and passed away in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1320; two of his half-brothers becoming chiefs of the
order after him in succession.</p>

<p>Eflākī informs us that he undertook the compilation of
his work at the express desire of his spiritual teacher,

<p>The work contains many hundreds of anecdotes, related
to Eflākī by trustworthy reporters, whose names are generally
given, and a few for which he vouches himself as an
eyewitness. Every anecdote is the account of a miracle
wrought by the living or the dead; or is the narrative of
some strange or striking event. It is, in fact, a species of
the Acts of the Apostles of the Mevlevī dervish fathers,
and is a rare specimen of what fervid religious enthusiasm
can invent or exaggerate, pious credulity can believe, and
confiding ignorance accept. In these days of Christian
“Spiritualism,” let not the reader be over-shocked at
learning that Muslim “Saints,” lovers of their Creator, and
beloved by Him in return, hold themselves and are held
by their dervish brethren to be the successors and spiritual
inheritors of the prophets, from Adam to Muhammed;
that, in virtue of this spiritual communion with God, they
know all the secrets and mysteries of  heaven and earth,
and not only suspend or overrule the laws of nature at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>their will, but also deal out death or disease by their
anger, health or prosperity by their blessing; the whole
in strict accordance, however, with the eternal will and
foreknowledge of Him by whom alone all things are
made.</p>

<p>The anecdotes translated are chosen as being characteristic
of various points of dervish credence or assertion.
Most of them inculcate some moral truth or point of
practical wisdom. A few will be found, however, to go
far beyond the credible; and one or two, unless totally
misunderstood by the translator, are simply and grossly
blasphemous. These last are here given as specimens of
the exaggerated dervish doctrines which cause the orthodox
among the ‘Ulemā<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> of Islām to hold all such quasi-religious
associations to be more or less heterodox.</p>

<p>The dervishes of Islām appear to be a kind of Gnostics.
They style themselves Poor, Impassioned, Adepts, and
Perfect. In many respects their doctrines correspond
with those of Buddha, Pythagoras, and Plato, making all
souls that are destined to salvation to be emanations from
the divine Light or Glory of God, in which they will be
again congregated; and all those doomed to perdition to
have been formed out of the Fire of His wrath, to which
also they will eventually be consigned.</p>

<p>It is but too patent to the translator that he is bound
to sue for the kind indulgence of a critical public, in offering
them the present volume in verse. He has no claim
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>to being a poet himself; and had never practised the art
of metrical composition until very lately. Sensible himself
to the earnestness of thought and beauty of diction
imbedded in the writings of the great poets of Islām, and
keenly aware of the condition of dry bones to which literal
prose translation almost always reduces a songster’s numbers,
he has preferred to clothe his author in a presentable
garb, though it be but a crumpled wrap, rather than exhibit
him to readers of taste as a mangled mass, stripped of all
beauty, and in great measure divested even of cognisable
form, through the conflict of dictions and diversities of
ideas.</p>

<p>He is in the position of the raindrop sung by Sa’dī
(see Chap, iii., No. 14, of the Anecdotes), and mentioned
of old by Chardin, Addison, and Sir William Jones. May
the thoughts in the Mesnevī be the gems that will make
his effort acceptable to the British public. At most, he is
but the diver who risks extinction in the hope that he
may have a chance to offer an acceptable pearl of price
to those for whom he has worked:—</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, Veled, Sultānu-’l-‘Ulemā</i> (<i>The Beauty of the
Religion of Islām, Son, Sultan of the Doctors of the Law</i>).</p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>The king of Khurāsān,<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn Muhammed, Khurrem-Shāh,
uncle of Jelālu-’d-Dīn Muhammed Kh’ārezm-Shāh,
and the proudest, as he was the most handsome man
of his time, gave his daughter, Melika’i-Jihān (Queen of
the World), as to the only man worthy of her, to Jelālu-’d-Dīn
Huseyn, el Khatībī, of the race of Abū-Bekr.</p>

<p>An ancestor of his was one of the original Muslim
conquerors of Khurāsān. He was himself very virtuous
and learned, surrounded with numerous disciples. He had
not married until then; which gave him many an anxious
and self-accusing thought.</p>

<p>He himself, the king, the king’s daughter, and the king’s
Vazīr were all four warned in a dream by the Prince of
the Apostles of God (Muhammed) that he should wed the
princess; which was done. He was then thirty years old.
In due course, nine months afterwards, a son was born to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
him, and was named Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Muhammed. He is
commonly mentioned as Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled.</p>

<p>When adolescent, this latter was so extremely learned
that the family of his mother wished to raise him to the
throne as king; but this he utterly rejected.</p>

<p>By the divine command, as conveyed in the selfsame
night, and in an identical dream, to three hundred of the
most learned men of the city of Balkh,<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> the capital of the
kingdom, where he dwelt, those sage doctors unanimously
conferred upon him the honorific title of Sultānu-’l-‘Ulemā,
and they all became his disciples.</p>

<p>Such are the names and titles by which he is more commonly
mentioned; but he is also styled Mevlānāyi Buzurg
(the Greater or Elder Master). Many miracles and prodigies
were attributed to him; and some men were found
who conceived a jealousy at his growing reputation and
influence.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 605 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1208) he, Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled, began
to preach against the innovations of the king and sundry
of his courtiers, declaiming against the philosophers and
rationalists, while he pressed all his hearers to study and
practise the precepts of Islām. Those courtiers maligned
him with the king, calling him an intriguer who had
designs on the throne. The king sent and made him an
offer of the sovereignty, promising to retire elsewhere
himself. Bahā answered that he had no concern with
earthly greatness, being a poor recluse; and that he would
willingly leave the country, so as to remove from the king’s
mind all misgivings on his score.</p>

<p>He accordingly quitted Balkh, with a suite of about forty
souls, after delivering a public address in the great mosque
before the king and people. In this address he foretold
the advent of the Moguls to overturn the kingdom, possess
the country, destroy Balkh, and drive out the king, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
would then flee to the Roman land, and there at length
be killed.</p>

<p>So he left Balkh, as the prophet (Muhammed) had fled
from Mekka to Medīna. His son Jelālu-’d-Dīn was then
five, and the elder brother, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn, seven years old.</p>

<p>The people everywhere on his road, hearing of his approach
or forewarned in dreams of his coming, flocked to
meet him and do him honour. Thus he drew near to
Bagdād. Here he was met by the great Sheykh Shahābu-’d-Dīn,
‘Umer, Suherverdī, the most eminent man of the
place, deputed by the Caliph Musta’zim to do him honour.
He became the guest of the Sheykh.</p>

<p>The Caliph sent him a present of three thousand sequins,
but he declined the gift as being money unlawfully
acquired. He also refused to visit the Caliph; but consented
to preach in the great mosque after the noon
service of worship on the following Friday, the Caliph
being present. In his discourse he reproached the Caliph
to his face with his evil course of life, and warned him
of his approaching slaughter by the Moguls with great
cruelty and ignominy. The Caliph again sent him rich
presents in money, horses, and valuables, but he refused
to accept them.</p>

<p>Before Bahā’u-’d-Dīn quitted Bagdād, intelligence was
received there of the siege of Balkh, of its capture, and of
its entire destruction, with its twelve thousand mosques,
by the Mogul army of five hundred thousand men commanded
by Jengīz in person (in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 608, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1211).
Fourteen thousand copies of the Qur’ān were destroyed,
fifteen thousand students and professors of the law were
slain, and two hundred thousand adult male inhabitants
led out and shot to death with arrows.</p>

<p>Bahā’u-’d-Dīn went from Bagdād to Mekka,<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> performed
the greater pilgrimage there, proceeding thence
to Damascus, and next to Malatia (Melitene, on the
Upper Euphrates), where, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 614 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1217), he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
heard of the death of Jengīz. The Seljūqī Sultan, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn
Keyqubād, was then sovereign of the land of Rome
(Rūm, <i>i.e.</i>, Asia Minor), and was residing at Sīwās (Sebaste).
In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 620 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1223) Sultan Jelālu-’d-Dīn, the dispossessed
monarch of Kh’ārezm (Chorasmia) was killed in a
battle fought by him in Azerbāyjān (Atropatene) against
the Sultans of Rome, Syria, and Egypt, when his forces
were totally defeated. And thus ended that great dynasty,
after ruling about a hundred and forty years.</p>

<p>Bahā’u-’d-Dīn went from Malatia and remained four
years near Erzinjān (the ancient Aziris, on the Western
Euphrates), in Armenia, at a college built for him by a
saintly lady, ‘Ismet Khātūn. She was the wife of the
local sovereign, Melik Fakhru-’d-Dīn. She and her husband
both died, and then Bahā’u-’d-Dīn passed on to
Larenda (in Cataonia), in Asia Minor, and remained there
about seven years at the head of a college, the princess
Melika’i-Jihān, his mother, being still with him.</p>

<p>Here it was that his younger son, Jelālu-’d-Dīn
Muhammed, the future author of the Mesnevī, attained
to man’s estate, being then eighteen years old; when,
in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 623 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1226), he married a young lady named
Gevher Khātūn, daughter of the Lala Sherefu-’d-Dīn, of
Samarqand. She gave birth in due course to Jelāl’s
eldest son, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn.</p>

<p>The king had now returned to his capital, Qonya (the
ancient Iconium). Hearing of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn’s great learning
and sanctity, the king sent and invited him to the
capital, where he installed him in a college, and soon professed
himself a disciple. Many miracles are related as
having been worked at Qonya by Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, who at
length died there on Friday, the 18th of Rebī’u-’l-ākhir,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 628 (February <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1231). The Sultan erected a
marble mausoleum over his tomb, on which this date is
recorded. Many miracles continued to occur at this
sanctuary. The Sultan died also a few years later, in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 634 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1236).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>(After the death of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled, and the acquisition
of still greater fame by his son Jelālu-’d-Dīn, who
received the honorific title of Khudāvendgār&mdash;<i>Lord</i>&mdash;the
father was distinguished from the son, among the disciples,
by the customary title of Mevlānā Buzurg&mdash;<i>the Greater or
Elder Master</i>. The traditions collected by Eflākī, relating
to this period, vary considerably from one another on
minor points of date and order of succession, though the
main facts come out sufficiently clear.)</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Jelāl’s son, Sultān Veled, related to Eflākī that his
father Jelāl used frequently to say, “I and all my
disciples will be under the protection of the <i>Great Master</i>,
my father, on the day of resurrection; and under His
guidance we shall enter the divine presence; God will
pardon all of us for His sake.”</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>It is related that when the <i>Great Master</i> departed this
life, his son, Jelālu-’d-Dīn, was fourteen years old. (This
is apparently a copyist’s error for “twenty-four.” Jalāl
is said to have been born in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 604&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1207.) He
married when seventeen (or eighteen); and often did he
say in the presence of the congregation of his friends,
“The <i>Great Master</i> will remain with me a few years. I
shall be in need of Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz (the capital
of Azerbāyjān); for every prophet has had an Abū-Bekr,
as Jesus had His apostles.”</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Shortly after the death of the Great Master Bahā’u-’d-Dīn
Veled, news was received by the Sultan ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn
of Qonya of the arrival of Sultan Jelālu-’d-Dīn Kh’ārezm-Shāh
on the borders of Asia Minor. The Sultan went and
prayed at the tomb of the deceased saint, and then prepared
to meet the Kh’ārezmians, who were in the neigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>bourhood
of Erzenu-’r-Rūm (Erzen of the Romans, the
ancient Arzes, now Erzerum). Scouts brought in the
intelligence that the Kh’ārezmians were very numerous;
and great anxiety prevailed among the Sultan’s troops.
He resolved to see for himself.</p>

<p>He put on a disguise and set out with a few followers,
on fleet horses, for the Kh’ārezmian camp. They gave
out that they were nomad Turks of the neighbourhood,
their ancestors having come from the Oxus; that latterly
the Sultan had withdrawn his favour from them; and
that, in consequence, they had for some time past been
looking for the Kh’ārezmian advent. This was reported
to the king, Jelālu-’d-Dīn, who sent for them and received
them kindly, giving them tents and assigning them
rations.</p>

<p>During the night King Jelālu-’d-Dīn began to reflect
that every one had hitherto spoken well of Sultan ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn,
and a doubt arose in his mind in consequence
respecting the story of these newcomers, especially as he
learned that the Sultan was on his march to meet him.
Consulting with the Prince of Erzenu-’r-Rūm, further
perquisition was postponed until the morrow.</p>

<p>But at midnight the deceased saint of Qonya, Bahā-Veled,
appeared in a dream to Sultan ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn, and
warned him to fly at once. The Sultan awoke, found it
was a dream, and went to sleep again. The saint now
appeared a second time. The Sultan saw himself seated
on his throne, and the saint coming to him, smiting him
on the breast with his staff, and angrily saying, “Why
sleepest thou? Arise!”</p>

<p>Now the Sultan did arise, quietly called his people,
saddled horses, and stole away out of the camp. Towards
morning King Jelāl caused guards to be placed round the
tents of the strangers to watch them. But afterwards,
when orders were given to bring them to the king’s
presence to be questioned, their tents were found to be
empty. Pursuit was attempted, but in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>After an interval the two armies came into collision.
The Sultan of Qonya was victorious. From that time
forward, whenever difficulties threatened, he always betook
himself to the shrine of the saint, Bahā Veled, who
always answered his prayers.</p>

<p>(As Sultan Jelālu-’d-Dīn Kh’ārezm-Shāh has already
been stated to have died in battle in Azerbāyjān in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1223, whereas the saint of Qonya did not die until
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1231 eight years afterwards, the discrepancy of that
date with the present anecdote is irreconcilable.)</p>


<h4>6.</h4>

<p>The Great Master, Bahā Veled, used to say that while
he himself lived no other teacher would be his equal, but
that when his son, Jelālu-’d-Dīn, should succeed him at
his death, that son of his would equal and even surpass
him.</p>


<h4>7.</h4>

<p>Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn Termīzī<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> is related to have
said that one night the door of the mausoleum of Bahā
Veled opened of itself, and that a great glory shone
forth from it, which gradually filled his house, so that
no shadow fell from anything. The glory then gradually
filled the city in like manner, spreading thence
over the whole face of nature. On beholding this prodigy
the Seyyid swooned away.</p>

<p>This vision is a sure indication that the whole human
race will one day own themselves the disciples of the
descendants of the great saint.</p>


<h4>8.</h4>

<p>Before he quitted Balkh, Bahā Veled one day saw a
man performing his devotions in the great mosque in his
shirt sleeves, with his coat upon his back. Bahā reproved
him, telling him to put on his coat properly and decently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
then to continue his devotions. “And what if I will
not?” asked the man in a disdainful tone. “Thy dead-like
soul will obey my command, quit thy body, and thou
wilt die!” answered Bahā. Instantly the man fell dead;
and crowds flocked to become disciples to the saint who
spoke with such power and authority.</p>


<h4>9.</h4>

<p>When Sultan ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn had fortified Qonya, he invited
Bahā Veled to mount to the terraced roof of the
palace, thence to survey the walls and towers. After his
inspection, Bahā remarked to the Sultan, “Against torrents,
and against the horsemen of the enemy, thou hast
raised a goodly defence. But what protection hast thou
built against those unseen arrows, the sighs and moans of
the oppressed, which overleap a thousand walls and sweep
whole worlds to destruction? Go to, now! strive to
acquire the blessings of thy subjects. These are a stronghold,
compared to which the walls and turrets of the
strongest castles are as nothing.”</p>


<h4>10.</h4>

<p>On one occasion Sultan ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn paid a visit to Bahā
Veled. In lieu of his hand the latter offered the tip of
his staff to be kissed by the Sultan, who thought within
himself: “The proud scholar!” Bahā read the Sultan’s
thoughts as a seer, and remarked in reply thereto:
“Mendicant students are bound to be humble and lowly.
Not so a Sultan of the Faith who has attained to the
utmost circumference of the orbit thereof, and revolves
therein.”</p>


<h4>11.</h4>

<p>A certain Sheykh Hajjāj, a disciple of Bahā Veled and
one of God’s elect not known to the herd of mankind,
quitted the college after the decease of his teacher, and
betook himself to his former trade of a weaver, therewith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
to gain an honest livelihood. He used to buy the coarsest
brown bread of unsifted flour, mash this up with water,
and break his fast with this sop alone. All the rest of
his earnings he saved up until they would reach to two
or three hundred piastres. This sum he would then carry
to the college, and place it in the shoes of his teacher’s
son, Jelālu-’d-Dīn, the new rector. This practice he continued
so long as he lived.</p>

<p>At his death a professional washer was appointed to
perform the last ablution for Sheykh Hajjāj. In the
execution of his office the washer was about to touch the
privities of the deceased, when the defunct seized his hand
with so strong a grip as to make him scream with pain
and fright. The friends came to rescue him, but they
were unable to release the imprisoned hand. They therefore
sent word to Jelālu-’d-Dīn of what had occurred.
He came and saw, knew the reason, and whispered into
the ear of the deceased man: “The poor simpleton has
been unaware of the high station of thy sanctity. Pardon
his unintentional transgression for my sake.” Immediately
the poor washer’s hand was released; but three
days afterwards he was himself washed and borne lifeless
to his grave.</p>


<h4>12.</h4>

<p>The Sultan had a governor of his childhood still living,
the Emīr Bedru-’d-Dīn Guhertāsh, commonly known as
the Dizdār (Castellan), whom he held in great esteem.
One day, as Bahā Veled was lecturing in the mosque, in
presence of the Sultan and his court, he suddenly called
upon the Dizdār to recite any ten verses of the Qur’ān, saying
he would then expound them to the congregation. The
Dizdār had been admiring the eloquence of the preacher’s
expositions. Upon this sudden call, without the slightest
hesitation and without ever having committed them to
memory, he recited the first ten verses of chapter xxiii.,
“The believers have attained to prosperity,” &amp;c., which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Bahā forthwith explained in such a manner as to draw
down the plaudits of the assembly. The Dizdār, with the
Sultan’s permission, went to the foot of the pulpit and
declared himself a disciple to Bahā. “Then,” said the
preacher, “as a thank-offering for this happy event, do
thou build and endow a college where my descendants
shall teach their disciples after me.” The Dizdār did so,
and richly endowed it. This is the college where Jelālu-’d-Dīn
afterwards lived. When the Dizdār died he left
all his possessions to enrich the foundation. (See chap.
iii. No. 69.)</p>


<h4>13.</h4>

<p>The Sultan had a dream (something like one of Nebuchadnezzar’s).
He saw himself with a head of gold, a
breast of silver, a belly of brass, thighs of lead, and shanks
of tin. Bahā Veled explained the dream as follows:—“All
will go well in the kingdom during thy lifetime. It will
be as silver in the days of thy son; as brass in the next
generation, when the rabble will get the upper hand.
Troubles will thicken during the next reign; and after
that the kingdom of Rome will go to ruin, the house of
Seljūq will come to an end, and unknown upstarts will
seize the reins of government.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn, Sirr-Dān, el Muhaqqiq, el Huseynī,
of the posterity of Yā-Sīn</i> (<i>Muhammed</i>).<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>


<p>(He is called Seyyid, the “<i>Syud</i>” of our East India
authorities, for the reason that he was a descendant of
the prophet, of whom Yā-Sīn is one of the titles, as it is also
the name of the thirty-sixth chapter of the Qur’ān, at the
head of which the two letters stand which form the name.
Burhānu-’d-Dīn means <i>The Proof of the Religion</i>; Sirr-Dān
signifies <i>The Confidant</i>, one who possesses a knowledge
of a secret or secrets, a mystery or mysteries. Muhaqqiq
is one who verifies, who probes the truth; and Huseynī
indicates that the Seyyid was of the branch of Huseyn,
the younger of the two sons of Fātima, Muhammed’s only
child that left posterity.)</p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn was popularly known by the
name of Sirr-Dān at Balkh, Bukhārā (Alexandria Oxiana?),
and Termīz. His discourse was continually running
upon the subjects of spiritual and mental phenomena, of
the mysteries of earth and of heaven.</p>

<p>When Bahā Veled quitted Balkh, the Seyyid went to
Termīz, and there secluded himself as a hermit. After a
while again he began to lecture in public on the significations
of knowledge. Suddenly, one morning, that of
Friday the 18th of Rebī’u-’l-ākhir, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 628 (February,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
1231 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), he cried out most bitterly, in a flood of tears,
“Alas! my master has passed away from this tabernacle
of dust to the abode of sincerity!” His words and the
date were noted down, and, on inquiry, after his arrival in
Qonya, were found to correspond exactly with the moment
of Bahā Veled’s decease.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>For forty days the disciples at Termīz mourned for the
death of the great teacher. At the end of that period
the Seyyid said: “The son of my master, his successor,
Jelālu-’d-Dīn Muhammed, is left alone and is wishing to
see me. I must go to the land of Rome and place myself
at his service, delivering over to him the trust which my
teacher confided to my safe-keeping.”</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>When the Seyyid reached Qonya, Bahā Veled had been
dead about a year, and Jelāl had gone to Larenda. The
Seyyid applied himself for several months to devotional
seclusion in one of the mosques of Qonya; after which he
sent off a letter to Jelāl by the hands of two mendicants,
saying: “Come and meet this stranger to thee at the
resting-place of thy father, for Larenda is not a place of
permanency for thee. From that hill (on which Bahā’s
mausoleum was built) a fire will shower down on the city
of Qonya.”</p>

<p>After reading this epistle Jelāl returned to Qonya with
all possible despatch. There he went at once to visit the
Seyyid, who came forth from the mosque to receive him.
They embraced. They now entered into conversation on
various subjects. So delighted was the Seyyid with the
expositions set forth by Jelāl that he kissed the soles of
his feet, and exclaimed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> “A hundredfold hast thou surpassed
thy father in all knowledge of the humanities; but
thy father was versed also in the mysteries of mute reality
and ecstasy. From this day forward my desire is that
thou shouldest also acquire that knowledge,&mdash;the knowledge
possessed by the prophets and the saints, which
is entitled <i>The Science of Divine Intuition</i>&mdash;the science
spoken of by God (in Qur’ān xviii. 64): ‘We have taught
him a science from within us.’ This knowledge did I
acquire from my teacher; do thou receive it from me, so
that thou mayest be the heir to thy father in spiritual
matters as well as in things temporal. Thou wilt then be
his second self.”</p>

<p>Jelāl complied with all the Seyyid pressed upon him.
He took the Seyyid to his college, and for nine years
received instruction from him. Some accounts make it
appear that Jelāl first became the Seyyid’s disciple at this
time; but others go to show that Bahā Veled gave Jelāl as
a pupil to the Seyyid at Balkh, and that the Seyyid used
now and then to carry Jelāl about on his shoulders, like
as is practised by the nursing-tutors&mdash;<i>lala</i>&mdash;of children.
(Compare chap. iii., Nos. 6 and 8.)</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Husāmu-’d-Dīn told us that Jelāl had informed him of
the following occurrence:—</p>

<p>The Seyyid once arrived at a certain city in Khurāsān
named Sāmānek. The chief people went forth to meet
him and show him honour, all excepting the Sheykhu-’l-Islām
of the place (the local vice-chancellor). Nevertheless
the Seyyid went to pay his respects to the legal
functionary. The latter went barefoot to the door of the
house to meet the Seyyid, whose hand he kissed, and to
whom he offered excuses for his seeming lack of courtesy.</p>

<p>In reply, the Seyyid said to him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> “I am come to inform
you that, on the 10th day of next month, Ramazān, you
will have occasion to go forth to a hot-bath. On your way
thither you will be assassinated by the emissaries of the
<i>Old Man of the Mountain</i>. This I communicate to thee,
that thou mayest set thy affairs in order, and repent thee
of thy sins.”</p>

<p>The Sheykhu-’l-Islām fell at the Seyyid’s feet, wailing;
but the latter remarked: “This is of no avail. Events are
in God’s hands, and He has so ordered it. Still, as thou
showest so much contrition, I may add, for thy consolation,
that thou wilt die in the faith, and shalt not be cut off
from the divine mercy and grace.”</p>

<p>And so it happened as thus predicted. The assassins
took his life on the very day foretold by the Seyyid.</p>

<p>(The stronghold, Alamūt, of the <i>Old Man of the Mountain</i>,
was stormed by forces sent against it by Helagū, grandson
of Jengīz, in about the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 654 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1256). The last
prince of the dynasty was sent to China, and there put to
death by the emperor; and thus these detestable scourges
of humanity were at length suppressed.)</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>After a certain time the Seyyid asked permission of
Jelāl to go for a while to Qaysariyya (Cæsarea), but Jelāl
could not spare him. So he remained at Qonya still.</p>

<p>Somewhat later a party of friends took the Seyyid out
for a ride among the vineyards. The thought occurred to
him that, without saying anything to anybody, he might
now easily abscond and get away to Qaysariyya. Scarcely
had he conceived this vagabond idea than his beast reared
with him, threw him, and broke his leg. His friends
raised him, set him again on his horse, and conducted him
to a neighbouring country-house to which Jelāl had also
come.</p>

<p>On seeing Jelāl the Seyyid exclaimed to him, “Is this
the proper way to reward your teacher&mdash;to break his leg?”
Jelāl at once ordered the Seyyid’s boot to be removed, and
saw that his foot and toes were crushed. He now passed
his hands along the injured limb and blew on it. The
limb was at once restored whole. Jelāl now granted
permission, and the Seyyid forthwith proceeded to Qaysariyya.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>


<h4>6.</h4>

<p>When the time was come that the Seyyid should die,
he told his servant to prepare for him an ewer of warm
water, and to go. The water was made ready, placed in
the Seyyid’s room, and the servant went forth. The
Seyyid called after him: “Go and proclaim that the
stranger Seyyid has departed to the other world.” He
then bolted the door, that none should enter to him.</p>

<p>The servant, however, had his curiosity excited by those
words, and went back to the door, to listen and to see
what might happen. Through a chink he saw his master
perform an ablution, arrange his dress, lie down on his
couch, and cry out: “All ye angels, saints, and heavens,
who have at any time intrusted to me a secret, come to
me now and receive back your charges. Ye are here all
present.”</p>

<p>He then recited the following hymn:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“God, my beloved, darling God, adored, to me incline;</div>
  <div class="verse">My soul receive; intoxicate, release poor me distraught.</div>
  <div class="verse">In Thee alone my heart finds peace; it fire with love divine;</div>
  <div class="verse">Take it unto Thyself; to it both worlds are naught.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were the Seyyid’s last words, ere he yielded up
his spirit. The servant carried the news to the Seyyid’s
friends, who gathered together, carried him forth, and
buried him.</p>

<p>A mausoleum was raised over his grave by a rich and
powerful disciple. The departed saint would not allow a
cupola to stand. Twice the dome was shaken down by
earthquakes, and in a dream the Seyyid himself forbade
its third edification.</p>

<p>After the usual forty days of mourning, a letter was
sent to Jelāl, who at once journeyed from Qonya to Qaysariyya,
and prayed at the tomb of his deceased teacher,
returning home again afterwards.</p>

God upon Earth.</i><a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>Jelālu-’d-Dīn is related to have been born at Balkh on
the 6th of Rebī’u-’l-evvel, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 604 (29th September 1207).</p>

<p>When five years old, he used at times to become
extremely uneasy and restless, so much so that his attendants
used to take him into the midst of themselves.</p>

<p>The cause of these perturbations was that spiritual
forms and shapes of the absent (invisible world) would
arise before his sight, that is, angelic messengers, righteous
genii, and saintly men&mdash;the concealed ones of the bowers
of the True One (spiritual spouses of God), used to appear
to him in bodily shape, exactly as the cherubim and
seraphim used to show themselves to the holy apostle of
God, Muhammed, in the earlier days, before his call to the
prophetic office; as Gabriel appeared to Mary, and as the
four angels were seen by Abraham and Lot; as well as
others to other prophets.</p>

<p>His father, Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled, the Sultānu-’l-‘Ulemā,
used on these occasions to coax and soothe him by saying:
“These are the Occult Existences. They come to present
themselves before you, to offer unto you gifts and presents
from the invisible world.”</p>

<p>These ecstasies and transports of his began to be
publicly known and talked about; and the affectionately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
honorific title of Khudāvendgār, by which he is so often
mentioned, was conferred upon him at this time by his
father, who used to address him and speak of him by this
title, as “My Lord.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>His son, Sultan Veled, related that there was a paper in
the handwriting of his father, Bahā Veled, which set forth
that at Balkh, when Jelāl was six years old, he was taking
the air one Friday, on the terraced roof of the house,
and reciting the Qur’ān, when some other children of good
families came in and joined him there.</p>

<p>After a time, one of these children proposed that they
should try and jump from thence on to a neighbouring
terrace, and should lay wagers on the result.</p>

<p>Jelāl smiled at this childish proposal, and remarked:
“My brethren, to jump from terrace to terrace is an act
well adapted for cats, dogs, and the like, to perform; but
is it not degrading to man, whose station is so superior?
Come now, if you feel disposed, let us spring up to the
firmament, and visit the regions of God’s realm.” As he
yet spake, he vanished from their sight.</p>

<p>Frightened at Jelāl’s sudden disappearance, the other
children raised a shout of dismay, that some one should
come to their assistance; when lo, in an instant, there he
was again in their midst; but with an altered expression
of countenance and blanched cheeks. They all uncovered
before him, fell to the earth in humility, and all declared
themselves his disciples.</p>

<p>He now told them that, as he was yet speaking to them,
a company of visible forms, clad in green raiment, had led
him away from them, and had conducted him about the
various concentric orbs of the spheres, and through the
signs of the Zodiac, showing him the wonders of the world
of spirits, and bringing him back to them so soon as their
cries had reached his ears.</p>

<p>At that age, he was used not to break his fast more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
often than once in three or four, and sometimes even
seven, days.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>A different witness, a disciple of Jelāl’s father, related
that Bahā Veled frequently affirmed publicly that his
Lord, Jelāl, was of exalted descent, being of the lineage of
a king, and also of an hereditary saint.</p>

<p>His maternal grandmother was a daughter of the great
Imām Es-Sarakhsī<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> (died at Damascus <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 571, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1175),
who was of the lineage of the Prophet. The mother of Es-Sarakhsī
was descended from the Caliph ‘Alī; and Jelāl’s
paternal grandmother was a daughter of the King of
Kh’ārezm, who resided at Balkh.</p>

<p>Jelāl’s paternal great-great-grandmother, also, the mother
of Ahmed, El-Khatībī, grandfather of Jelāl’s father, was
a daughter of a king of Balkh. These particulars establish
that Jelāl was well descended on both sides, in a mundane
and in a spiritual sense. The well-known proverb&mdash;</p>

<p>
“Hereditary disposition ever insinuates itself,”
</p>

<p class="nindent">proved fully true in his most illustrious case.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>When Jelāl was seven years old, he used every morning
to recite the very short chapter, cviii., of the Qur’ān&mdash;</p>

<p>“Verily we have given unto thee the abounding good.
Therefore, do thou perform thy devotions unto thy Lord,
and slaughter victims. Verily, he who evil entreateth
thee is one who shall leave no issue after him.”</p>

<p>He used to weep as he recited these inspired words.</p>

<p>Suddenly, God one day vouchsafed to appear to him
visibly. On this he fainted away. Regaining consciousness,
he heard a voice from heaven, that said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>
<p>“O Jelālu-’d-Dīn! By the majesty (jelāl) of Our glory,
do thou henceforward cease to combat with thyself; for We
have exalted thee to the station of ocular vision.”</p>

<p>Jelāl vowed, therefore, out of gratitude for this mark of
grace, to serve the Lord to the end of his days, to the
utmost of his power; in the firm hope that they who
followed him would also attain to that high grade of
favour and excellence.</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Two years after the death of his father, Jelāl went
from Qonya to Haleb (Aleppo) to study. (This account is
altogether subversive, as to time and date, of that already
given in chap. ii. No. 3.)</p>

<p>As he was known to be a son of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled,
and was also an apt scholar, his professor showed him
every attention.</p>

<p>Others were offended, and evinced their jealousy at the
preference thus accorded to him. They complained to the
governor of the city that Jelāl was immoral, as he was
in the habit, each night, of quitting his cell at midnight
for some unknown purpose. The governor resolved to see
and judge for himself. He therefore hid himself in the
porter’s room.</p>

<p>At midnight, Jelāl came forth from his room, and went
straight to the locked gate of the college, watched by the
governor. The gate flew open; and Jelāl, followed at a
distance by the governor, went through the streets to the
locked city gate. This, too, opened of itself; and again
both passed forth.</p>

<p>They went on and came to the tomb of Abraham (at
Hebron, about 350 miles distant), the “Friend of the All-Merciful.”
There a domed edifice was seen, filled with a
large company of forms in green raiment, who came forth
to meet Jelāl, and conducted him into the building.</p>

<p>The governor hereupon lost his senses through fright,
and did not recover until after the sun had risen.</p>

<p>Now, he could see nothing of a domed edifice, nor one
single human being. He wandered about on a trackless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
plain for three days and three nights, hungry, thirsty, and
footsore. At length he sank under his sufferings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the porter of the college had given intelligence
of the governor’s pursuit after Jelāl. When his
officers found that he did not return, they sent a numerous
party of guards to seek him. These, on the second day,
met Jelāl. He told them where they would find their
master. The next day, late, they came up with him,
found him to be nearly dead, and brought him home.</p>

<p>The governor became a sincere convert, and a disciple
to Jelāl for ever after.</p>

<p>(A parallel tale is told of Jelāl’s fetching water from
the Tigris for his father by night when he was a little
child at Bagdad. There, too, all the gates opened to him
of themselves.)</p>


<h4>6.</h4>

<p>It is related that the Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn was often
heard to narrate that, when Jelāl was a child, the Seyyid
was his governor and tutor. He had often taken Jelāl up
on his shoulder, and so carried him to the empyrean.
“But now,” he would add, “Jelāl has attained to such
eminence of station that he carries me up.” These sayings
of the Seyyid were repeated to Jelāl, who confirmed them
with the remark: “It is quite true; and a hundredfold
more also; the services rendered to me by that man are
infinite.”</p>


<h4>7.</h4>

<p>When Jelāl went to Damascus to study, he passed by
Sīs in Upper Cilicia. There, in a cave, dwelt forty Christian
monks, who had a great reputation for sanctity, but in
reality were mere jugglers.</p>

<p>On the approach of Jelāl’s caravan to the cave, the
monks caused a little boy to ascend into the air, and there
remain standing between heaven and earth.</p>

<p>Jelāl noticed this exhibition, and fell into a reverie.
Hereupon, the child began to weep and wail, saying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the man in the reverie was frightening him. The monks
told him not to be afraid, but to come down. “Oh!” cried
the child, “I am as though nailed here, unable to move
hand or foot.”</p>

<p>The monks became alarmed. They flocked around
Jelāl, and begged him to release the child. After a time,
he seemed to hear and understand them. His answer
was: “Only through the acceptance of Islām by yourselves,
all of you, as well as by the child, can he be
saved.”</p>

<p>In the end they all embraced Islām, and wished to follow
Jelāl as his disciples. He recommended them, however, to
remain in their cave, as before, to cease from practising
jugglery, and to serve God in the spirit and in truth.
So he proceeded on his journey.</p>


<h4>8.</h4>

<p>Jelāl remained seven years, or four years, at Damascus;
and there he first saw his great friend Shemsu-’d-Dīn of
Tebrīz, clothed in his noted black felt and peculiar cap.
Shems addressed him; but he turned away, and mixed in
the crowd. Soon afterwards, he returned to Qonya by
way of Qaysariyya. At this latter place, under the
guiding supervision of his spiritual teacher, the Seyyid
Burhānu-’d-Dīn, Jelāl fasted three consecutive periods of
forty days each,<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> with only a pot of water and two or
three loaves of barley bread. He showed no signs of
suffering. Burhān now pronounced him perfect in all
science, patent and occult, human and spiritual. (Compare
chap. ii. No. 3.)</p>


<h4>9.</h4>

<p>In the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 642 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1244), Shemsu-’d-Dīn of
Tebrīz came to Qonya.</p>

<p>This great man, after acquiring a reputation of superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
sanctity at Tebrīz, as the disciple of a certain holy man,
a basket-maker by trade, had travelled about much in
various lands, in search of the best spiritual teachers, thus
gaining the nickname of Perenda (the <i>Flier</i>, <i>Bird</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>He prayed to God that it might be revealed to him who
was the most occult of the favourites of the divine will,
so that he might go to him and learn still more of the
mysteries of divine love.</p>

<p>The son of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled, of Balkh, was designated
to him as the man most in favour with God. Shems
went, accordingly, to Qonya; arriving there on Saturday,
the 26th of Jemādà-’l-ākhir, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 642 (December <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1244). He engaged a lodging at an inn, and pretended to
be a great merchant. In his room, however, there was
nothing but a broken water-pot, an old mat, and a bolster
of unbaked clay. He broke his fast once in every ten or
twelve days, with a damper soaked in broth of sheep’s
trotters.</p>

<p>One day, as he was seated at the gate of the inn, Jelāl
came by, riding on a mule, in the midst of a crowd of
students and disciples on foot.</p>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn arose, advanced, and took hold of the
mule’s bridle, addressing Jelāl in these words: “Exchanger
of the current coins of recondite significations, who knowest
the names of the Lord! Tell me: Was Muhammed the
greater servant of God, or Bāyezīd of Bestām?”</p>

<p>Jelāl answered him: “Muhammed was incomparably the
greater&mdash;the greatest of all prophets and all saints.”</p>

<p>“Then,” rejoined Shemsu-’d-Dīn, “how is it that Muhammed
said: ‘We have not known Thee, O God, as
Thou rightly shouldest be known,’ whereas Bāyezīd said:
‘Glory unto me! How very great is my glory’?”</p>

<p>On hearing this question, Jelāl fainted away. On recovering
his consciousness, he took his new acquaintance
home with him. They were closeted together for weeks
or months in holy communications.</p>

<p>Jelāl’s disciples at length became impatient, raising a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
fearful and threatening tumult; so that, on Thursday, the
21st of Shewwāl, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 643 (March <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1246), Shemsu-’d-Dīn
mysteriously disappeared; and Jelāl adopted, as a
sign of mourning for his loss, the drab hat and wide cloak
since worn by the dervishes of his order.</p>

<p>It was about this time, also, that he first instituted the
musical services observed by that order, as they perform
their peculiar waltzing. All men took to music and dancing
in consequence. Fanatics objected, out of envy. They
said Jelāl was gone mad, even as the chiefs of Mekka
had said of old of the Prophet. His supposed malady
was attributed to the malefic influence of Shemsu-’d-Dīn
of Tebrīz.</p>


<h4>10.</h4>

<p>The widow of Jelāl, Kirā (<i>or</i> Girā) Khātūn, a model of
virtue, the Mary of her age, is related to have seen, through
a chink in the door of the room where he and Shems were
closeted in spiritual communion, that the wall suddenly
opened, and six men of majestic mien entered by the cleft.</p>

<p>These strangers, who were of the occult saints, saluted,
bowed, and laid a nosegay at the feet of Jelāl, although it
was then in the depth of the midwinter season. They
remained until near the hour of dawn worship, when they
motioned to Shemsu-’d-Dīn to act as leader on the occasion
of the service. He excused himself, and Jelāl performed
the office. The service of worship over, the six strangers
took leave, and passed out by the same cleft in the wall.</p>

<p>Jelāl now came forth from the chamber, bringing the
nosegay in his hand. Seeing his wife in the passage,
he gave her the nosegay, saying that the strangers had
brought it as an offering to her.</p>

<p>The next day, she sent her servant, with a few leaves
from her nosegay, to the perfumers’ mart of the city, to
inquire what might be the flowers composing it, as she
had never seen their like before. The merchants were
all equally astonished; no one had ever seen such leaves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
At length, however, a spice merchant from India, who was
then sojourning in Qonya, saw those leaves, and knew
them to be the petals of a flower that grows in the south
of India, in the neighbourhood of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The wonder now was: How did these Indian flowers get
to Qonya; and in the depth of winter, too?</p>

<p>The servant carried the leaves back, and reported to his
lady what he had learnt. This increased her astonishment
a hundredfold. Just then Jelāl made his appearance, and
enjoined on her to take the greatest care of the nosegay,
as it had been sent to her by the florists of the lost
earthly paradise, through those Indian saints, as a special
offering.</p>

<p>It is related that she preserved them as long as she
lived, merely giving a few leaves, with Jelāl’s express
permission, to the Georgian wife of the king. If any one
suffered with any disease of the eyes, one leaf from that
nosegay, applied to the ailing part, was an instant cure.
The flowers never lost their fragrance or freshness. What
is musk compared with such?</p>


<h4>11.</h4>

<p>To prove that man lives through God’s will alone, and
not by blood, Jelāl one day, in the presence of a crowd of
physicians and philosophers, had the veins of both his arms
opened, and allowed them to bleed until they ceased to
flow. He then ordered incisions to be made in various
parts of his body; but not one drop of moisture was anywhere
obtainable. He now went to a hot bath, washed,
performed an ablution, and then commenced the exercise
of the sacred dance.</p>


<h4>12.</h4>

<p>One of Jelāl’s disciples died, and there was a consultation
among his friends as to whether he should be buried
in a coffin or without one.</p>

<p>Another disciple, after Jelāl had been consulted, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
told them to do as they pleased, made the observation
that it would be better to bury their relative without a
coffin. On being asked why, he answered: “A mother
can better nurse her child, than can her child’s brother.
The earth is the mother of the human race, and the wood
of a coffin is also the earth’s child; therefore, the coffin
is the man’s brother. Man’s corpse should be committed,
then, not to a coffin, but to mother earth, his loving, affectionate
parent.”</p>

<p>Jelāl expressed his admiration for this apposite and sublime
doctrine, which, he said, was not to be found written
in any then extant book.</p>

<p>The name of the disciple who made this beautiful remark
was Kerīmu-’d-Dīn, son of Begh-Tīmūr.</p>


<h4>13.</h4>

<p>Many of the chief disciples of Jelāl have related that
he himself explained to them, as his reasons for instituting
the musical service of his order, with their dancing, the
following reflections:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>
<p>“God has a great regard for the Roman people. In
answer to a prayer of the first Caliph, Abū-Bekr, God made
the Romans a chief receptacle of His mercy; and the land
of the Romans (Asia Minor) is the most beautiful on the
face of the earth. But the people of the land were utterly
void of all idea of the riches of a love towards God, and of
the remotest shade of a taste for the delights of the inner,
spiritual life. The great Causer of all causes caused a
source of affection to arise, and out of the wilderness of
causelessness raised a means by which I was attracted
away from the land of Khurāsān to the country of the
Romans. That country He made a home for my children
and posterity, in order that, with the elixir of His grace,
the copper of their existences might be transmuted into
gold and into philosopher-stone, they themselves being
received into the communion of saints. When I perceived
that they had no inclination for the practice of religious
austerities, and no knowledge of the divine mysteries, I
imagined to arrange metrical exhortations and musical
services, as being captivating for men’s minds, and more
especially so for the Romans, who are naturally of a lively
disposition, and fond of incisive expositions. Even as a
sick child is coaxed into taking a salutary, though nauseous
medicine, so, in like manner, were the Romans led by art
to acquire a taste for spiritual truth.”</p>


<h4>14.</h4>

<p>As an instance of the great value attached to the poetry
of Jelāl, the following anecdote is related:—</p>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn Hindī, (Prince of Shīrāz in the province
of Fars, Southern Persia), wrote a flattering letter to
the renowned poet, Sheykh Sa’dī, of Shīrāz (who lived
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 571-691, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1175-1291, and was consequently a contemporary
of Jelāl’s), begging him to select the best ode,
with the most sublime thoughts, that he knew of as
existing in Persian, and to send it to him, for presentation
to the great Khān of the Moguls (who then ruled over
nearly all Asia).</p>

<p>It so happened that the ode by Jelāl had just become
known at Shīrāz, which commences:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Divine love’s voice each instant left and right is heard to sound,</div>
  <div class="verse">We’re bound for heaven. To witness our departure who’ll be found?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This ode had captivated the minds of all the men of
culture in the city; and this ode Sa’dī selected, wrote it
out, and sent it to the prince, with the remark: “A monarch,
of auspicious advent, has sprung up in the land of Rome,
from whose privacy these are some of the breathings.
Never have more beautiful words been uttered, and never
will be. Would that I could go to Rome, and rub my face
in the dust under his feet!”</p>

<p>The prince thanked Sa’dī exceedingly, and sent him
valuable presents in return. Eventually, Sa’dī did go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
“Rome,” arrived in Qonya, and had the gratification to
kiss the hand of Jelāl. He was well received in that city
by the dervish circle.</p>

<p>The prince was himself a disciple of Sheykh ... ’d-Dīn,
of Bakharz (in Khurāsān, about midway between
Tūrshīz and Herāt), to whom he sent a copy of the ode, to
learn what the Sheykh would think of it. All the learned
men of Bakharz assembled round the Sheykh. He read
the ode attentively, and then burst out into exclamations
of the wildest delight and most fervid admiration, rending
his garments, and acting as though mad. At length he
calmed down and said: “O wonderful man! O thou
champion of the Faith! Thou pole of the heavens and of
the earth! Verily, thou art a wonderful Sultan, who hast
appeared on earth! In good sooth, all the Sheykhs of
bygone ages who were seers, have been frustrated in not
having seen this man! They would have supplicated the
Lord of Truth to allow them to meet him! But it was
not to be; and this mercy will last until the end of time,
as has been sung:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“A fortune, by the men of ancient times in dreams long sought,</div>
  <div class="verse">Has been vouchsafed to modern men; without their efforts caught.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>
<p>“One ought to put on ironed shoes, and take in hand
an ironed staff, to set out at once and visit this great light.
I make it a legacy to all my friends to do so without the
least delay, if they have the means and the strength, so as
to achieve the happiness and secure the honour of making
the acquaintance of this prince, so obtaining the grace and
favour of hearing him. His father, Bahā Veled, and his
ancestors, were great Sheykhs and most illustrious; their
great progenitor having been the first Caliph, Abū-Bekr,
the glorious Confirmer of the truth spoken by the Apostle
of God. I am myself old and infirm, unequal to the
fatigues of travel. Otherwise, I would have walked, not
on the soles of my feet, but on the tips of my great toes,
to visit that eminent man.”</p>

<p>The Sheykh’s eldest son, Muzahhiru-’d-Dīn, was there
present. To him the Sheykh addressed himself, saying:
“My son, I do hope that thy eyes will behold this sacred
visage; and, if God so will, convey to him my salutation
and my respects.”</p>

<p>After the death of the old man, his son went to Rome,
had the felicity to see Jelāl, and presented his father’s
message. He returned to Bakharz; but it is said that a
son of his lies buried at Qonya.</p>


<h4>15.</h4>

<p>Kirā Khātūn, the widow of Jelāl, is reported to have
related to a friend that there was in their household a
candlestick of the height of a man, before which Jelāl
used to stand on foot the night through, until daydawn,
studying the writings of his father.</p>

<p>One night, a company of the genii, dwellers in the
college where Jelāl and his wife lived, appeared to her in
a body, to complain of the great inconvenience and suffering
to which they were subjected by this practice of
Jelāl’s, and saying: “We can put up with it no longer.
Take care, lest we do a mischief to some one in the
college.”</p>

<p>The lady reported this complaint of the genii to her
husband. He merely smiled, and took no further notice
of the matter for several days.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, however, he spoke of it, and
told his wife to trouble herself no more about the threat
of the genii, as he had converted them all. They had become
disciples of his, and would certainly do no harm to
any friend or dependent of their teacher.</p>


<h4>16.</h4>

<p>It was related by one of the chief of Jelāl’s disciples, a
butcher by trade, a trainer of dogs for the chase, and a
purveyor of horses of the best kind, which he used to sell
to princes and grandees at high prices, that, at a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
time, Jelāl was much exercised by visions from the spiritual
world, so that for forty days he was as though beside himself,
passing through the streets with his head bare, and his
turban twisted round his neck.</p>

<p>After that, he came suddenly one day, bathed in perspiration,
to the butcher, and said he wanted a certain unbroken
horse to be saddled for him immediately. The
butcher, with the help of three stable-men, managed with
the utmost difficulty to saddle the horse and bring him
out. Jelāl mounted him without opposition, and set off
in a southerly direction. The butcher asked whether he
should accompany him, and Jelāl replied: “Give me your
prayers and holy good wishes.”</p>

<p>In the evening Jelāl returned covered with dust. The
poor horse, though of gigantic frame, was reduced to mere
skin and bone, being nearly broken-backed with fatigue.</p>

<p>The next day he came again, and asked for another
horse, better than the one of yesterday, mounted it, and
rode off. He returned at the hour of sunset devotions,
and this horse also was reduced to a pitiable condition.
The butcher dared not offer a word of remonstrance.</p>

<p>On the third day he came again, mounted a third horse,
and returned as before, at sunset. He sat down now in
the most composed manner possible, and called out cheerily:
“Good news! Glad tidings, O ye of the Faith! That dog
of hell has gone back to his pit of fire!”</p>

<p>The butcher was too much astonished at his manner to
feel any inclination to inquire what these words might
mean; but a certain number of days afterwards, a large
caravan came into Qonya from Syria, and brought news
that the Mogul army had besieged Damascus, and had
reduced it to straits.</p>

<p>Helaw Khan (Holagu, Helagu) had taken Bagdad in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 655 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1257-58). Two years later, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 657 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1259-60), he advanced against Aleppo and Syria, sending
his general, Ketbuga, against Damascus with a numerous
army. He laid siege to the city. But the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
witnessed, with their very own eyes, that Jelāl came and
joined himself there to the forces of Islām. He inflicted
defeat on the Mogul forces, who were compelled to retreat,
totally frustrated.</p>

<p>The butcher was overjoyed at this welcome intelligence,
and went forthwith to communicate the news to Jelāl.
The latter smilingly replied: “Yes, yes! Jelālu-’d-Dīn
was the horseman who obtained a victory over the enemy,
and showed himself a Sultan in the eyes of the people of
Islām.” On hearing this, his disciples rent the air with
their shouts of joy and triumph, and the townspeople of
Qonya decked out and illuminated the city, holding public
rejoicings.</p>

<p>This miracle of power became noised abroad, and everywhere
Jelāl’s friends and adherents were transported with
ecstasy at its occurrence.</p>


<h4>17.</h4>

<p>On one occasion a rich merchant of Tebrīz came to
Qonya. He inquired of his agents there who was the
most eminent man of learning and piety in the city, as
he wished to go and pay his respects to him. He remarked
to them: “It is not merely for the sake of making money
that I travel about in every country on earth; I desire
also to make the acquaintance of every man of eminence
I can find in each city.”</p>

<p>His correspondents told him that the Sheykhu-’l-Islām
of the capital had a great reputation for learning and piety,
and that they would be proud to present him to that
celebrated luminary. Accordingly, he selected a number
of rarities from among his store, to the value of thirty
sequins; and the party set out to visit the great lawyer.</p>

<p>The merchant found the dignitary lodged in a great
palace, with guards at the gate, crowds of servants and
attendants in the courtyard, and eunuchs, pages, grooms,
ushers, chamberlains, and the like, in the halls.</p>

<p>Turning to his conductors, he expressed some doubt as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to whether they had not, by mistake, brought him to the
king’s palace. They quieted his fears, and led him into
the presence of the great fountain of legal erudition. He
felt a very great dislike for all he saw; and he remarked
to his friends: “A great lawyer is never anything the worse
for possessing a clear conscience. A physician may himself
indulge in sweetmeats; but he does not prescribe them
to a patient suffering with fever.”</p>

<p>He now offered his presents; and then inquired of the
great lawyer whether he could solve a doubt under which
he was then labouring. This he stated as follows:—“Of
late, I have been sustaining a series of losses. Can you
indicate a way by which I may escape from that unfortunate
position? I give, every year, the fortieth part of
my liable possessions to the poor; and I distribute alms
besides, to the extent of my power. I cannot conceive,
therefore, why I am unfortunate.”</p>

<p>Other remarks he made also to the same effect. They
appeared to be lost on the great luminary, who affected to
be otherwise preoccupied. At length the merchant took
leave without obtaining a solution to his difficulty.</p>

<p>The day following he inquired of his friends whether
there did not chance to be, in the great city, some poor
mendicant of exemplary piety, to whom he might offer
his respects, and from whom he might, haply, learn what
he longed to know, together with advice that would be of
service to him. They answered: “Just such a man as thou
describest is our Lord, Jelālu-’d-Dīn. He has forsaken all
pleasures, save only his love towards God. Not only has
he given up all concern for worldly matters, he has also
renounced all care as to a future state. He passes his
nights, as well as his days, in the worship of God; and he
is a very ocean of knowledge in all temporal and spiritual
subjects.”</p>

<p>The Tebrīz merchant was enchanted with this information.
He begged to see that holy man, the bare mention
of whose virtues had filled him with delight. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
accordingly conducted him to the college of Jelāl, the merchant
having privately furnished himself with a rouleau of
fifty sequins in gold as his offering to the saint.</p>

<p>When they reached the college, Jelāl was sitting alone
in the lecture-hall, immersed in the study of some books.
The party made their obeisances, and the merchant felt
himself completely overpowered at the aspect of the
venerable teacher; so that he burst into tears, and could
not utter a word. Jelāl addressed him, therefore, as
follows:—</p>

<p>“The fifty sequins thou hast provided as thy offering
are accepted. But better for thee than these are the two
hundred sequins thou hast lost. God, whose glory be
exalted, had determined to visit thee with a sore judgment
and a heavy trial; but, through this thy visit here,
He hath pardoned thee, and the trial is averted from thee.
Be not dismayed. From this day forth thou shalt not
suffer loss; and that which thou hast already suffered
shall be made up to thee.”</p>

<p>The merchant was equally astonished and delighted at
these words; more so, however, when Jelāl proceeded with
his discourse: “The cause and reason of thy bygone losses
and misfortunes was, that, on a certain day thou wast in the
west of Firengistān (Europe), where thou wentest into a
certain ward of a certain city, and there sawest a poor
Firengī (European) man, one of the greatest of God’s
cherished saints, who was lying stretched out at the
corner of a market-place. As thou didst pass by him,
thou spattest on him, evincing aversion from him. His
heart was grieved by thy act and demeanour. Hence the
visitations that have afflicted thee. Go thou, then, and
make thy peace with him, asking his forgiveness, and
offering him our salutations.”</p>

<p>The merchant was petrified at this announcement.
Jelāl then asked him: “Wilt thou that we this instant
show him to thee?” So saying, he placed his hand on
the wall of the apartment, and told the merchant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
behold. Instantly, a doorway opened in the wall, and
the merchant thence perceived that man in Firengistān,
lying down in a market-place. At this sight he bowed
down his head and rent his garments, coming away from
the saintly presence in a state of stupor. He remembered
all these incidents as facts.</p>

<p>Immediately commencing his preparations, he set out
without delay, and reached the city in question. He inquired
for the ward he wished to visit, and for the man
whom he had offended. Him he discovered lying down,
stretched out as Jelāl had shown him. The merchant
dismounted from his beast, and made his obeisance to the
prostrate Firengī dervish, who at once addressed him thus:
“What wilt thou that I do? Our Lord Jelāl suffereth me
not; or otherwise, I had a desire to make thee see the
power of God, and what I am. But now, draw near.”</p>

<p>The Firengī dervish then clasped the merchant to his
bosom, kissed him repeatedly on both cheeks, and then
added: “Look now, that thou mayest see my Lord and
Teacher, my spiritual Master, and that thou mayest
witness a marvel.” The merchant looked. He saw the
Lord Jelāl immersed in a holy dance, chanting this hymn,
and entranced with sacred music:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“His kingdom’s vast and pure; each sort its fitting place finds there;</div>
  <div class="verse">Cornelian, ruby, clod, or pebble be thou on His hill.</div>
  <div class="verse">Believe, He seeks thee; disbelieve, He’ll haply cleanse thee fair;</div>
  <div class="verse">Be here a faithful Abū-Bekr; Firengī there; at will.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the merchant happily reached Qonya on his
return, he gave the salutations of the Firengī saint, and
his respects, to Jelāl; and distributed much substance
among the disciples. He settled at Qonya, and became
a member of the fraternity of the Pure Lovers of God.</p>


<h4>18.</h4>

<p>Jelāl was one day passing by a street, where two men
were quarrelling. He stood on one side. One of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
men called out to the other: “Say what thou will; thou
shalt hear from me a thousandfold for every word thou
mayest utter.”</p>

<p>Hereupon Jelāl stepped forward and addressed this
speaker, saying: “No, no! Whatsoever thou have to say,
say it to me; and for every thousand thou mayest say to
me, thou shalt hear from me one word.”</p>

<p>On hearing this rebuke, the adversaries were abashed,
and made their peace with one another.</p>


<h4>19.</h4>

<p>One day, a very learned professor brought all his pupils
to pay their respects to Jelāl.</p>

<p>On their way to him, the young men agreed together to
put some questions to Jelāl on certain points of Arabic
grammar, with the design of comparing his knowledge
in that science with that of their professor, whom they
looked upon as unequalled.</p>

<p>When they were seated, Jelāl addressed them on various
fitting subjects for a while, and thereby paved the way for
the following anecdote:—</p>

<p>“An ingenuous jurist was once travelling with an Arabic
grammarian, and they chanced to come to a ruinous well.</p>

<p>“The jurist hereupon began to recite the text (of Qur’ān
xxii. 44): ‘And of a ruined well.’</p>

<p>“The Arabic word for ‘well’ he pronounced ‘bīr,’ with
the vowel long. To this the grammarian instantly objected,
telling the jurist to pronounce that word with a
short vowel and hiatus&mdash;bi’r, so as to be in accord with
the requirements of classical purity.</p>

<p>“A dispute now arose between the two on the point.
It lasted all the rest of the day, and well on into a pitchy
dark night; every author being ransacked by them, page
by page, each sustaining his own theory of the word. No
conclusion was arrived at, and each disputant remained of
his own opinion still.</p>

<p>“It so happened in the dark, that the grammarian slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
into the well, and fell to the bottom. There he set up a wail
of entreaty: ‘O my most courteous fellow-traveller, lend
thy help to extricate me from this most darksome pit.’</p>

<p>“The jurist at once expressed his most pleasurable
willingness to lend him that help, with only one trifling
condition&mdash;that he should confess himself in error, and
consent to suppress the hiatus in the word ‘bi’r.’ The
grammarian’s answer was ‘Never.’ So in the well he
remained.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jelāl, “to apply this to yourselves. Unless
you will consent to cast out from your hearts the
‘<i>hiatus</i>’ of indecision and of self-love, you can never hope
to escape from the noisome pit of self-worship,&mdash;the well
of man’s nature and of fleshly lusts. The dungeon of
‘Joseph’s well’ in the human breast is this very ‘self-worship;’
and from it you will not escape, nor will you
ever attain to those heavenly regions&mdash;‘the spacious land
of God’” (Qur’ān iv. 99, xxix. 56, xxxix. 13).</p>

<p>On hearing these pregnant words, the whole assembly
of undergraduates uncovered their heads, and with fervent
zeal professed themselves his spiritual disciples.</p>


<h4>20.</h4>

<p>There was a great and good governor (apparently) of
Qonya, of the name of Mu’īnu-’d-Dīn, whose title was the
Perwāna (moth or fly-wheel, viz., of the far-distant Mogul
Emperor, resident at the court of the king). He was a
great friend to the dervishes, to the learned, and to Jelāl,
whose loving disciple he was.</p>

<p>One day, a company of the dervishes and learned men
united in extolling the Perwāna to the skies, in Jelāl’s
presence. He assented to all they advanced in that
respect, and added: “The Perwāna merits a hundredfold
all your eulogiums. But there is another side to the
question, which may be exemplified by the following
anecdote:—</p>

<p>“A company of pilgrims were once proceeding towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Mekka, when the camel of one of the party fell down in
the desert, totally exhausted. The camel could not be
got to rise again. Its load was, therefore, transferred to
another beast, the fallen brute was abandoned to its fate,
and the caravan resumed its journey.</p>

<p>“Ere long the fallen camel was surrounded by a circle
of ravenous wild beasts,&mdash;wolves, jackals, &amp;c. But none
of these ventured to attack him. The members of the
caravan became aware of this singularity, and one of them
went back to investigate the matter. He found that an
amulet had been left suspended on the animal’s neck;
and this he removed. When he had retreated to a short
distance, the hungry brutes fell upon the poor camel, and
soon tore him piecemeal.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jelāl, “this world is in an exactly similar
category with that poor camel. The learned of the world
are the company of pilgrims, and our (Jelāl’s) existence
among them is the amulet suspended round the neck of
the camel&mdash;the world. So long as we remain so suspended,
the world will go on, the caravan will proceed.
But so soon as the divine mandate shall be spoken: ‘O thou
submissive spirit, come thou back to thy Lord, content and
approved’ (Qur’ān lxxxix. 27-8), and we be removed from
the neck of the world-camel, people will see how it shall
fare with the world,&mdash;how its inhabitants shall be driven,&mdash;what
shall become of its sultans, its doctors, its scribes.”</p>

<p>It is said that these words were spoken a short time
before Jelāl’s death. When he departed this life, not
much time elapsed ere the Sultan, with many of his great
men of learning and nobles, followed him to the grave,
while troubles of all kinds overwhelmed the land for a
season, until God again vouchsafed it peace.</p>


<h4>21.</h4>

<p>During one of his expositions, Jelāl said: “Thou seest
naught, save that thou seest God therein.”</p>

<p>A dervish came forward and raised the objection that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the term “therein” indicated a receptacle, whereas it
could not be predicated of God that He is comprehensible
by any receptacle, as this would imply a contradiction in
terms. Jelāl answered him as follows:—</p>

<p>“Had not that unimpeachable proposition been true, we
had not proffered it. There is therein, forsooth, a contradiction
in terms; but it is a contradiction in time, so that
the receptacle and the recepted may differ,&mdash;may be two
distinct things; even as the universe of God’s qualities is
the receptacle of the universe of God’s essence. But, these
two universes are really one. The first of them is not
He; the second of them is not other than He. Those,
apparently, two things are in truth one and the same.
How, then, is a contradiction in terms implied? God
comprises the exterior and the interior. If we cannot say
He is the interior, He will not include the interior. But
He comprises all, and in Him all things have their being.
He is, then, the receptacle also, comprising all existences,
as the Qur’ān (xli. 54) says: ‘He comprises all things.’”</p>

<p>The dervish was convinced, bowed, and declared himself
a disciple.</p>


<h4>22.</h4>

<p>Jelāl was one day seated in the shop of his great disciple
the Goldbeater, Salāhu-’d-Dīn; and was surrounded by a
circle of other disciples, listening to his discourse; when
an old man came rushing in, beating his breast, and uttering
loud lamentations. He entreated Jelāl to help him in
his endeavours to recover his little son, a child seven years
old, lost for several days past, in spite of every effort made
to find him.</p>

<p>Jelāl expressed his disapprobation at the extreme importance
the old man appeared to attach to his loss; and
said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> “Mankind in general have lost their God. Still,
one does not hear that they go about in quest of Him,
beating their breasts and making a great noise. What,
then, has happened to thee so very particular, that thou
makest all this fuss, and degradest thyself, an elder, by
these symptoms of grief for the loss of a little child?
Why seekest thou not for a time the Lord of the whole
world, begging assistance of Him, that peradventure thy
lost Joseph may be found, and thou be comforted, as was
Jacob on the recovery of his child?”</p>

<p>The old man at once followed Jelāl’s advice, and begged
forgiveness of God. Just then, news was brought him
there that his son had been found. Many who were witnesses
of these circumstances became devoted followers of
Jelāl.</p>


<h4>23.</h4>

<p>Jelāl was one day lecturing, when a young man of distinction
came in, pushed his way, and took a seat higher
up than an old man, one of the audience.</p>

<p>Jelāl at once remarked: “In days of yore it was the
command of God, that, if any young man should take precedence
of an elder, the earth should at once swallow him
up; such being the divine punishment for that offence.
Now, however, I see that young men, barely out of leading-strings,
show no respect for age, but trample over those in
years. They have no dread of the earth’s swallowing
them up, nor any fear of being transformed into apes.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
It happened, however, that one morning the Victorious
Lion of God, ‘Alī, son of Abū-Tālib, was hasting from
his house to perform his devotions at dawn in the mosque
of the Prophet. On his way, he overtook an old man, a
Jew, who was going in the same direction. The future
Caliph, out of innate nobility and politeness of nature,
had respect for the Jew’s age, and would not pass him,
though the Jew’s pace was slow. When ‘Alī reached
the mosque, the Prophet was already bowed down in his
devotions, and was about to chant the ‘<i>Gloria</i>;’ but, by
God’s command, Gabriel came down, laid his hand on the
Prophet’s shoulder, and stopped him, lest ‘Alī should lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the merit attaching to his being present at the opening of
the dawn service; for it is more meritorious to perform
that early service once, than to fulfil the devotions of a
hundred years at other hours of the day. The Prophet
has said: ‘The first act of reverence at dawn worship is
of more value than the world and all that is therein.’</p>

<p>“When the Apostle of God had concluded his <i>worship</i>,
offered up his <i>customary prayers</i>, and recited his usual
<i>lessons</i> from the Qur’ān, he turned, and asked of Gabriel
the occult cause of his interruption at that time. Gabriel
replied that God had not seen fit that ‘Alī should be deprived
of the merit attaching to the performance of the
first portion of the dawn worship, through the respect he
had shown to the old Jew he had overtaken, but whom
he would not pass.</p>

<p>“Now,” remarked Jelāl, “when a saint like ‘Alī showed
so much respect for a poor old misbelieving Jew, and
when God viewed his respectful consideration in so
highly favourable a manner, you may all infer how He
will view any honour and veneration shown to an elderly
saint of approved piety, whose beard has grown grey in
the service of God, and whose companions are the elect
of their Maker, whose chosen servant he is; and what
reward He will mete out in consequence. For, in truth,
glory and power belong to God, to the Apostle, and to
the believers, as God hath Himself declared (Qur’ān lxiii.
8): ‘Unto God belongeth the power, and to the apostle,
and to the believers.’</p>

<p>“If then,” added he, “ye wish to be prosperous in your
affairs, take fast hold on the skirts of your spiritual elders.
For, without the blessing of his pious elders, a young man
will never live to be old, and will never attain the station
of a spiritual elder.”</p>


<h4>24.</h4>

<p>One day Jelāl took as his text the following words
(Qur’ān xxxi. 18):<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>—“Verily, the most discordant of all
sounds is the voice of the asses.” He then put the
question: “Do my friends know what this signifies?”</p>

<p>The congregation all bowed, and entreated him to expound
it to them. Jelāl therefore proceeded:—</p>

<p>“All other brutes have a <i>cry</i>, a <i>lesson</i>, and a <i>doxology</i>,
with which they commemorate their Maker and Provider.
Such are, the <i>yearning cry</i> of the camel, the <i>roar</i> of the
lion, the <i>bleat</i> of the gazelle, the <i>buzz</i> of the fly, the <i>hum</i>
of the bee, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“The angels in heaven, and the genii, have their doxologies
also, even as man has his doxology&mdash;his <i>Magnificat</i>,
and various forms of worship for his heart (or mind) and
for his body.</p>

<p>“The poor ass, however, has nothing but his <i>bray</i>. He
sounds this bray on two occasions only: when he desires
his female, and when he feels hunger. He is the slave of
his lust and of his gullet.</p>

<p>“In like manner, if man have not in his heart a doxology
for God, a cry, and a love, together with a secret and a care
in his mind, he is less than an ass in God’s esteem; for He
has said (Qur’ān vii. 178): ‘They are like the camels; nay,
they are yet more erring.’” He then related the following
anecdote:—</p>

<p>“In bygone days there was a monarch, who, by way of
trial, requested another sovereign to send him three things,
the worst of their several kinds that he could procure;
namely, the worst article of food, the worst dispositioned
thing, and the worst animal.</p>

<p>“The sovereign so applied to sent him some <i>cheese</i>, as
the worst food; an Armenian slave, as the worst-dispositioned
thing; and an ass, as the worst of animals. In the
superscription to the epistle sent with these offerings, the
sovereign quoted the verse of Scripture pointed out above.”</p>


<h4>25.</h4>

<p>On a certain day, the Lord Jelālu-’d-Dīn went forth to
the country residence of the saint Husāmu-’d-Dīn, riding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
on an ass. He remarked: “This is the saddle-beast of
the righteous. Several of the prophets have ridden on
asses: as Seth, Ezra, Jesus, and Muhammed.”</p>

<p>It so chanced that one of his disciples was also mounted
on an ass. The creature suddenly began to bray; and the
rider, annoyed at the occurrence, struck the ass on the
head several times.</p>

<p>Jelāl remonstrated: “Why strike the poor brute?
Strikest thou him because he bears thy burden? Returnest
thou not thanks for that thou art the rider, and he
the vehicle? Suppose now, which God forbid, that the
reverse were the case. What wouldst thou have done?
His cry arises from one or the other of two causes, his
gullet or his lust. In this respect, he shares the common
lot of all creatures. They are all continually thus actuated.
All, then, would have to be scolded and beaten over
the head.”</p>

<p>The disciple was abashed. He dismounted, kissed the
hoof of his ass, and caressed him.</p>


<h4>26.</h4>

<p>On a certain occasion, one of his disciples complained
to Jelāl of the scantiness of his means and the extent of
his needs. Jelāl answered: “Out upon thee! Get thee
gone! Henceforward, count me not a friend of thine;
and so, peradventure, wealth may come to thee.” He then
related the following anecdote:—</p>

<p>“It happened, once, that a certain disciple of the
Prophet said to him: ‘I love thee!’ The Prophet answered:
‘Why tarriest thou, then? Haste to put on a
breastplate of steel, and set thy face to encounter misfortunes.
Prepare thyself, also, to endure straitness, the
special gift of the friends and lovers (of God and His
Apostle)!’”</p>

<p>Another anecdote, also, he thus narrated:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> “A Gnostic
adept once asked of a rich man which he loved best,
riches or sin. The latter answered that he loved riches
best. The other replied: ‘Thou sayest not the truth.
Thou better lovest sin and calamity. Seest thou not that
thou leavest thy riches behind, whilst thou carriest thy
sin and thy calamity about with thee, making thyself
reprehensible in the sight of God! Be a man! Exert
thyself to carry thy riches with thee, and sin not; since
thou lovest thy riches. What thou hast to do is this:
Send thy riches to God ere thou goest before Him thyself;
peradventure, they may work thee some advantage; even
as God hath said (Qur’ān lxxiii. 20): ‘And that which ye
send before, for your souls, of good works, shall ye find
with God. He is the best and the greatest in rewarding.”</p>


<h4>27.</h4>

<p>It is related that one day the Perwāna, Mu’īnu-’d-Dīn,
held a great assembly in his palace. To this meeting
were collected together all the Doctors of the Law, the
Sheykhs, the men of piety, the recluses, and the strangers
who had congregated from various lands.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the law had taken their places in the
highest seats. The Perwāna had had a great desire that
Jelāl should honour the assembly with his presence. He
had a son-in-law, Mejdu-’d-Dīn, governor to the young
princes, the sons of the king. This son-in-law of his was
a disciple of Jelāl’s, and a man of very eminent qualities,
with great faith in his teacher. He offered to go and
invite Jelāl to the meeting.</p>

<p>Hereupon, the arch-sower of doubts and animosities in
the human breast spread among the chiefs of the law, there
present, the suspicion that, if Jelāl should come, the
question of precedence would arise: “Where should he
be seated?” They all agreed that they were themselves
in their proper places, and that Jelāl must find a seat
where he could.</p>

<p>Mejdu-’d-Dīn delivered the Perwāna’s courteous message
to his teacher. Jelāl, inviting Husāmu-’d-Dīn and others
of his disciples to accompany him, set out for the Per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>wāna’s
palace. The disciples went on a little ahead, and
Jelāl brought up the procession.</p>

<p>When Husām entered the apartment of the Perwāna, all
present rose to receive him, making room for him in the
upper seats. Lastly, Jelāl made his appearance.</p>

<p>The Perwāna and other courtiers crowded forward to
receive Jelāl with honour, and kissed His Lordship’s
blessed hands with reverence, expressing regret that he
had been put to inconvenience by his condescension. He
returned compliment for compliment, and was shown
upstairs.</p>

<p>On reaching the assembly room, he saw that the grandees
had occupied the whole of the sofa, from end to end. He
saluted them, and prayed for God’s grace to be showered
upon them; seating himself then in the middle of the
floor. Husāmu-’d-Dīn immediately rose from his seat,
descended from the sofa, and took a place by the side of
Jelāl.</p>

<p>The grandees of the assembly now arose also, excepting
those who, in spite and pride, had formed the confederacy
mentioned above. These kept their seats. Some of them
were of the greatest eminence in learning; and one, especially,
was not only very learned, but also eloquent, witty,
and bold.</p>

<p>He, seeing what had taken place, and that all the men
of rank had quitted the sofa, to seat themselves on the
floor, asked in a jocose manner: “Where, according to the
rules of the Order, is the chief seat in an assembly?”</p>

<p>Some one answered him: “In an assembly of the
learned, the chief seat is in the middle of the sofa, where
the professor always sits.” Another added: “With
recluses, the cell of solitude is the chief seat.” A third
said: “In the convents of dervish brethren, the chief seat
is the lower end of the sofa, where, in reality, people put
off their shoes.”</p>

<p>After these remarks, some one present, as an experiment,
asked Jelāl, saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> “In your rule and opinion, where is
the chief seat?” His answer was: “The chief seat is
that where one’s beloved is found.” The interrogator now
asked: “And where is your beloved?” Jelāl replied:
“Thou must be blind, not to see.”</p>

<p>Jelāl then arose, and began to sing. Many joined; and
the singing became so enthusiastic, that the nobles rent
their garments.</p>

<p>It so happened that, after Jelāl’s death, this interlocutor
of his went to Damascus, and there became blind. Friends
flocked to visit him, and to condole with him. He wept
bitterly, and cried aloud: “Alas, alas! what have I not
suffered? That very moment, when Jelāl gave me that
fatal answer, a black veil seemed to fall down over my
eyes, so that I could not distinguish objects clearly, or
their colours. But I have hope and faith in him, that,
out of his sublime generosity, he will yet take pity on
me, and pardon my presumption. The goodness of the
saints is infinite; and Jelāl himself hath said: ‘Despair
not because of one sin; for the ocean of divine mercy
accepteth penitence.’”</p>

<p>The foregoing incident is also related with the following
variation:—</p>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz had just then returned to
Qonya, and was among those who accompanied Jelāl to
the Perwāna’s palace, sitting down near him on the floor.
When the question was put: “Where is your beloved?”
Jelāl arose, and cast himself on the breast of Shems.
That occurrence it was that made Shems, from that time
forward, a man of mark in all Qonya.</p>


<h4>28.</h4>

<p>There was in Qonya a great physician, of eminence and
ability, who used occasionally to visit Jelāl.</p>

<p>On one of those days, Jelāl requested him to prepare
seventeen purgative draughts by a certain time, propitious
for taking medicine, as that number of his friends
required them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>When the specified time came, Jelāl went to the
physician’s house, and received the seventeen draughts.
He immediately began, and, in the physician’s presence,
drank off the whole seventeen in succession, thence returning
home.</p>

<p>The physician followed him there, to render the assistance
he felt sure would be wanted. He found Jelāl
seated as usual, in perfect health, and lecturing to his
disciples. On inquiring how he felt, Jelāl answered, in
the words so often repeated in the Qur’ān (ii. 23, &amp;c.):
“Beneath which rivers flow.” The physician recommended
Jelāl to abstain from water. Jelāl instantly
ordered ice to be brought and broken up small. Of
this he swallowed an inordinate quantity, while the
physician looked on.</p>

<p>Jelāl then went to a hot-bath. After bathing, he
began to sing and dance; continuing in those exercises
three whole days and nights, without intermission.</p>

<p>The physician declared this to be the greatest miracle
ever wrought by prophet or by saint. With his whole
family, and with many of the greatest in the medical
profession, he joined himself to the multitude of Jelāl’s
disciples of the most sincere.</p>


<h4>29.</h4>

<p>The Perwāna is related to have said publicly, in his
own palace, that Jelāl was a matchless monarch, no
sovereign having ever appeared in any age like unto
him; but that his disciples were a very disreputable
set.</p>

<p>These words were reported to them, and the company
of disciples were greatly scandalised at the imputation.
Jelāl sent a note to the Perwāna, of which the following
is the substance:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>
<p>“Had my disciples been good men, I had been their
disciple. Inasmuch as they were bad, I accepted them
as my disciples, that they might reform and become good,&mdash;of
the company of the righteous. By the soul of my
father, they were not accepted as disciples, until God had
made Himself responsible that they would attain to mercy
and grace, admitted among those accepted of Him. Until
that assurance was given, they were not received by me,
nor had they any place in the hearts of the servants of
God. ‘The sons of grace are saved; the children of wrath
are sick; for the sake of Thy mercy, we, a people of wrath,
have come to Thee.’”</p>

<p>When the Perwāna had read and considered these
words, he became still more attached to Jelāl; arose,
came to him, asked pardon, and prayed for forgiveness
of God, distributing largely of his bounty among the
disciples.</p>


<h4>30.</h4>

<p>Another great and good man once observed: “Jelāl is
a great saint and a sovereign; but he must be dragged
forth from among his disciples.” This was reported to
Jelāl, who smiled, and said: “If he can!”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he added: “Why, then, is it that my
followers are looked upon with spite by the men of the
world? It is because they are beloved of God, and favourably
regarded by Him. I have sifted all mankind; and
all have fallen through my sieve, excepting these friends
of mine. They have remained. My existence is the life
of my friends, and the existence of my friends is the
life of the men of the world, whether they know this,
or whether they ignore it.”</p>


<h4>31.</h4>

<p>There was a young merchant, whose house was near
Jelāl’s college, and who had professed himself a sincere
and ardent disciple.</p>

<p>He conceived a desire and intention to make a voyage
to Egypt; but his friends tried to dissuade him. His intention
was reported to Jelāl, who strictly and rigorously
prohibited his undertaking the voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The young man could not divest himself of his desire,
and had no peace of mind; so one night he clandestinely
stole away, and went off to Syria. Arrived at Antioch,
he embarked in a ship, and set sail. As God had willed,
his ship was taken by Firengī pirates. He was made prisoner,
and was confined in a deep dungeon, where he had
a daily portion of food doled out to him, barely sufficient
to keep his body and soul together.</p>

<p>He was thus kept imprisoned forty days, during which
he wept bitterly, and reproached himself for having been
disobedient to the injunction of Jelāl; saying: “This is
the reward of my crime. I have disobeyed the command
of my sovereign, following after my own evil propensity.”</p>

<p>Precisely on the night of the fortieth day, he saw Jelāl
in a dream, who addressed him, and said: “To-morrow, to
whatever questions these misbelievers may ask thee, do
thou return the answer: ‘I know.’ By that means shalt
thou be released.” He awoke bewildered, returned thanks
to Heaven, and sat down in holy meditation, awaiting the
solution of the dream.</p>

<p>Shortly, he saw a company of Firengī people come to
him, with whom was an interpreter. They asked him:
“Knowest thou aught of philosophy, and canst thou
practise therapeutics? Our prince is sick.” His answer
was: “I know.”</p>

<p>They immediately took him out of the pit, led him to a
bath, and dressed him in a handsome vestment of honour.
They then conducted him to the residence of the sick
man.</p>

<p>The young merchant, inspired of God, ordered them to
bring him seven fruits. These he prepared with a little
scammony, and made the whole into a draught, which he
administered to the patient.</p>

<p>By the grace of God, and the intercession of the saints,
his treatment was crowned with success, after two or three
visits. The Firengī prince recovered; and by reason that
the favour of Jelāl was upon that young merchant, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
he was utterly illiterate, he became a philosopher. Jelāl
assisted him.</p>

<p>When the Firengī prince had entirely recovered his
health, and had arisen from his sick-bed, he told the young
merchant to ask of him whatsoever he might wish. He
asked for his freedom, and for leave to return home, that
he might rejoin his teacher. He then related all that had
befallen him;&mdash;his disobedience, his vision, and the assistance
of Jelāl. The whole audience of Firengīs, without
sight of Jelāl, became believers in him, and wooers of
him.</p>

<p>They set the young merchant free, and allowed him to
depart, bestowing on him rich presents and a bountiful
outfit.</p>

<p>On his arrival at the metropolis, before going to his
own house, he hastened to pay his respects to Jelāl. On
beholding the sacred features from afar, he threw himself
on the earth, embraced Jelāl’s two feet, kissed them,
rubbed his face upon them, and wept. Jelāl raised him,
kissed both his cheeks, and said: “It was a narrow escape
through thy curing the Firengī prince. Thou didst abscond;
but henceforward, do thou remain at home, and
occupy thyself in earning what is lawful. Take contentment
as thy exemplar. The sufferings of the sea, the
commotion of the ship, the calamity of captivity, and the
darkness of the dungeon, are so many evils. Contentment
is a very blessing from God.”</p>


<h4>32.</h4>

<p>Jelāl one day was going from his college into the town,
when by chance he met a Christian monk, who made him
an obeisance. Jelāl asked him which was the elder, himself
or his beard. The monk replied: “I am twenty
years older than my beard. It came forth that number
of years later.” Jelāl answered him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> “Then I pity thee.
Thy young beard has attained to maturity, whereas thou
hast remained immature, as thou wast. Thou art as black,
and as weak, and as untutored as ever. Alas for thee, if
thou change not, and ripen not!”</p>

<p>The poor monk at once renounced his rope girdle, threw
it away, professed the faith of Islām, and became a
believer.</p>


<h4>33.</h4>

<p>A company of black-habited ones (Christian priests or
monks) chanced to meet Jelāl one day, as they came from
a distant place. When his disciples espied them afar off,
they expressed their aversion from them by exclaiming:
“O the dark-looking, disagreeable things!”</p>

<p>Jelāl remarked: “In the whole world, none are more
generous than they are. They have given over to us, in
this life, the faith of Islām, purity, cleanliness, and the
various modes of worshipping God; while, in the world
to come, they have left to us the everlasting abodes of
paradise, the large-eyed damsels, and the pavilions, as
well as the sight of God, of which they will enjoy no
share; for God hath said (Qur’ān vii. 48): ‘Verily God
hath made both of them forbidden things to the misbelievers!’
They walk in darkness and misbelief, willingly
incurring the torments of hell. But, let only the sun of
righteousness rise upon them suddenly, and they will
become believers.”</p>

<p>Being now come near enough, they all made their
obeisances to Jelāl, entered into conversation with him,
and professed themselves true Muslims. Jelāl now
turned to his disciples, and added: “God swallows up
the darkness in the light, and the light in the darkness.
He also makes in the darkness a place for the light.” The
disciples bowed, and rejoiced.</p>


<h4>34.</h4>

<p>A certain well-known disciple related that, on one
occasion, Jelāl and his friends went forth to the country-seat
of Husām, and there held a grand festival of holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
music and dancing until near daybreak. Jelāl then left
off, to give his followers a little rest.</p>

<p>They dispersed about the grounds; and the narrator
took a seat in a spot from whence he could see and
observe Jelāl. The others all fell asleep; but he occupied
himself with reflections on the miracles performed by
various of the prophets and of the saints. He thought to
himself: “I wonder whether this holy man works miracles.
Of course he does; only, he keeps the fact quiet,
to avoid the inconveniences of notoriety.”</p>

<p>Hardly had the thought crossed his mind, when Jelāl
called him by name. On his approaching Jelāl, the latter
stooped, picked up a pebble from the earth, placed it on
the back of his own hand, and said to him: “Here, take
this; it is thy portion; and be thou one of the thankful”
(Qur’ān vii. 141).</p>

<p>The disciple examined the pebble by the light of the
moon, and saw that it was a large ruby, exceedingly clear
and brilliant, not to be found in the treasuries of kings.</p>

<p>Utterly astounded, he shrieked out, and swooned away;
awaking the whole company with his shout; for he was a
very loud-voiced man. On recovery, he told the others
what had occurred. He also expressed to Jelāl his contrition
for the temerity of his reflections.</p>

<p>Jelāl told him to carry the stone to the queen, and to
mention how he had become possessed of it. The queen
accepted it, had it valued, and gave to him a hundred and
eighty thousand pieces of silver in return, besides rich
gifts. She also distributed presents to all the members
of the fraternity.</p>


<h4>35.</h4>

<p>A certain sheykh, son of a sheykh, and a man of great
reputation for learning, came to Qonya, and was respectfully
visited by all the people of eminence residing there.</p>

<p>It so happened that Jelāl and his friends were gone
that day to a mosque in the country; and the new-comer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
offended at Jelāl’s not hasting to visit him, made the remark
in public: “Has Jelāl never heard the adage: ‘The
newly-arrived one is visited’?”</p>

<p>One of Jelāl’s disciples chanced to be present, and heard
this remark. On the other hand, Jelāl was expounding
sublime truths in the mosque to his disciples, when
suddenly he exclaimed, “My dear brother! I am the
newly-arrived one, not thou. Thou and those like thee
are bound to visit me, and so gain honour to yourselves.”</p>

<p>All his audience were surprised at this apostrophe;
wondering to whom it was addressed. Jelāl then spake
a parable: “One man came from Bagdād, and another
went forth out of his house and ward; which of the two
ought to pay the first visit to the other?”</p>

<p>All agreed in opinion that the man from Bagdād ought
to be visited by the other. Then Jelāl explained, thus:
“In reality, I am returned from the Bagdād of <i>nulliquity</i>,
whereas this dearly beloved son of a sheykh, who has
come here, has gone forth from a ward of this world. I
am better entitled, therefore, to be visited than is he. I
have been hymning in the Bagdād of the world of spirits
the heavenly canticle: ‘I am the Truth,’ since a time
anterior to the commencement of the present war, ere the
truth obtained its victory.” The disciples expressed their
concurrence, and rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>By and by, the sheykh’s son was informed of this wonder.
He at once arose, went on foot to visit Jelāl, uncovered
his head, and owned that Jelāl was right. He
further declared himself Jelāl’s disciple, and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> “My
father enjoined me to put on ironed sandals, taking an
iron-shod staff in my hand, and go forth in quest of Jelālu-’d-Dīn,
since it is a duty of all to visit and reverence him
who has spoken the truth and reposes on the truth. But
the majesty of Jelāl is a hundredfold greater than what
my father explained to me.”</p>


<h4>36.</h4>

<p>Jelāl once commanded one of his attendants to go and
arrange a certain matter. The attendant answered: “God
willing.”</p>

<p>Upon this, Jelāl was wroth, and shouted to him:
“Stupid, garrulous fool!” The attendant fainted and
foamed at the mouth.</p>

<p>The disciples interceded. Jelāl expressed his forgiveness;
and the attendant recovered.</p>


<h4>37.</h4>

<p>On the occasion of a grand religious commemoration at
the house of the Perwāna, in the presence of the Sultan
Ruknu-’d-Dīn, this monarch was taken unwell, and the
exercises were suspended, only, one of the disciples continued
to sing and shout.</p>

<p>The Sultan remarked: “How ill-behaved is that man!
Does he pretend to be more ecstatic than his teacher
Jelālu-’d-Dīn?”</p>

<p>Jelāl heard this, and answered the king: “Thou art
unable to withstand an attack of fever. How then canst
thou expect a man devoured with an enthusiasm that
threatens to swallow up even heaven itself, to calm down
on a sudden?”</p>

<p>When the disciples heard this, they set up a shout; and
the Sultan, after himself witnessing one or two of the
mighty signs wrought by Jelāl, made his obeisance to him,
and became a disciple.</p>


<h4>38.</h4>

<p>It has been related by some that the final overthrow of
the rule of the Seljūqī dynasty in Asia Minor (in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 700,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1300), was in this manner:—</p>

<p>The Sultan Ruknu-’d-Dīn had adopted Jelāl as his
(spiritual) father. After a while, he held a great dervish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
festival in the palace. But, about that period, a certain
Sheykh Bāba had created for himself a great name in
Qonya, and certain intriguers had led the king to visit
him.</p>

<p>It was shortly after that visit that the king held the
revival in honour of Bāba in the Hall of the Bowls.</p>

<p>The sheykh was met and introduced in state by the
court officials, and was then installed on the throne, with
the Sultan seated on a chair by his side. Jelāl now made
his appearance, saluted, and took his seat in a corner of
the hall. Portions of the Qur’ān were recited, and exhortations
were delivered, with hymns.</p>

<p>The Sultan then turned to Jelāl, and spoke: “Be it
known to the Lord Jelāl, to the Doctors of the Law, and
to the grandees, that I have adopted the Sheykh Bāba
as my (spiritual) father, who has accepted me as his dutiful
and affectionate son.”</p>

<p>All present shouted their approval, and prayed for a
blessing on the arrangement. But Jelāl, burning with
divine jealousy, instantly exclaimed (in words traditionally
related of the prophet, Muhammed): “Verily, Sa’d is a
jealous man; but I am more jealous than Sa’d; and God
is still more jealous than I am.” To this he further added:
“Since the Sultan has made the sheykh his father, we
will make some other our son.” So saying, he gave his
usual religious shout of ecstasy, and stalked out from the
assembly.</p>

<p>Husāmu-’d-Dīn related that he saw the Sultan, when
Jelāl thus quitted the presence, turn pale, as though shot
with an arrow.</p>

<p>The grandees ran to stop Jelāl; but he would not
return.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, the officers of state adopted the
resolution to invite the Sultan to go to another city, that
they might take measures to get rid of Sheykh Bāba. The
Sultan now went to consult Jelāl, and ask for his blessing
before setting out. Jelāl advised him not to go. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
matter had, however, been officially promulgated, and there
was no possibility to alter arrangements.</p>

<p>On arriving at the other town, the Sultan was conducted
to a private apartment, and forthwith strangled with a
bowstring. Ere his breath failed, he invoked the name of
Jelāl.</p>

<p>At that moment Jelāl was at his college, lost to consciousness
in the enthusiasm of a musical service.
Suddenly, he put his two forefingers into his two ears,
and ordered the trumpets and chorus to join in. He
then shouted vociferously, and recited aloud two of his
own odes, of which one commences thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“My words were: ‘Go not; I’m thy friend; the world is rife</div>
  <div class="verse">With threats of dire destruction; I’m the Fount of Life.’”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent5">·     ·     ·     ·     ·     ·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the service was over, the disciples requested
Jelāl’s son, Sultan Veled, to inquire of his father what
all this might signify. In reply, he merely put off his
cloak, and said aloud: “Let us perform the service for the
burial of the dead.”</p>

<p>He acted as Precentor in the service, and all present
joined in. Then, without waiting for his son to put any
question, he addressed the assembly, saying: “Yea,
Bahā’u-’d-Dīn and my friends! They have strangled the
poor Sultan Ruknu-’d-Dīn. In his agony, he called on
me, and shrieked. God had so ordained. I did not wish
his voice to ring in my ears, and interrupt my devotions.
He will fare better in the other world.”</p>

<p>(There is a serious anachronism in the foregoing account.
Sultan Ruknu-’d-Dīn, whose name was Suleyman son of
Key-Khusrew, was put to death by order of the Mogul
emperor Abaqa Khān, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 664 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1265), thirty-six
years before the final extinction of the dynasty by order of
Qāzān Khān, between Abaqa and whom no less than four
emperors reigned. Besides this, Jelāl himself died in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 672 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1273), twenty-seven years before the last
of the Seljūqī sovereigns, Key-Qubād son of Ferā<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>murz
son of Key-Kāwus, was slaughtered, together with
all living members of the race. Historians differ much
respecting the names and order of succession of the last
sovereigns of the dynasty; and the present anecdote shows
how confused had become on the spot the legend of these
puppets. Ruknu-’d-Dīn caused his own brother to be
poisoned, as he had become jealous of the favour shown
to that brother by the Mogul emperor. His own death
was the reward of that act.)</p>


<h4>39.</h4>

<p>One day, in lecturing on self-abasement and humility,
Jelāl spake a parable from the trees of the field, and said:
“Every tree that yields no fruit, as the pine, the cypress,
the box, &amp;c., grows tall and straight, lifting up its head on
high, and sending all its branches upwards; whereas all
the fruit-bearing trees droop their heads, and trail their
branches. In like manner, the Apostle of God was the
most humble of men. Though he carried within himself
all the virtues and excellencies of the ancients and of the
moderns, he, like a fruitful tree, was more humble, and
more of a dervish, than any other prophet. He is related
to have said: ‘I am commanded to show consideration to
all men, to be kind to them; and yet, no prophet was ever
so ill-treated by men as I have been.’ We know that he
had his head broken, and his teeth knocked out. Still he
prayed: ‘O our Lord God, guide Thou my people aright;
for they know not what they do.’ Other prophets have
launched denunciations against the people to whom they
were sent; and certainly, none have had greater cause to
do so, than Muhammed.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Old Adam’s form was moulded first of clay from nature’s face;</div>
  <div class="verse">Who’s not, as mire, low-minded’s not true son of Adam’s race.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In like manner, Jelāl also had the commendable habit
to show himself humble and considerate to all, even the
lowest; especially so to children, and to old women. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
used to bless them; and always bowed to those who bowed
to him, even though these were not Muslims.</p>

<p>One day he met an Armenian butcher, who bowed to
him seven times. Jelāl bowed to him in return. At
another time he chanced upon a number of children who
were playing, and who left their game, ran to him, and
bowed. Jelāl bowed to them also; so much so, that one
little fellow called out from afar: “Wait for me until I
come.” Jelāl moved not away, until the child had come,
bowed, and been bowed to.</p>

<p>At that time, people were speaking and writing against
him. Legal opinions were obtained and circulated, to the
effect that music, singing, and dancing, are unlawful. Out
of his kindly disposition, and love of peace, Jelāl made no
reply; and after a while all his detractors were silenced, and
their writings clean forgotten, as though they had never
been written; whereas, his family and followers will endure
to the end of time, and will go on increasing continually.</p>


<h4>40.</h4>

<p>Jelāl once wrote a note to the Perwāna, interceding for
a disciple who had been involved in an act of homicide,
and had taken refuge in the house of another.</p>

<p>The Perwāna demurred; saying it was a very grave
matter, a question of blood. Jelāl thereupon facetiously
replied: “A homicide is popularly termed ‘a son of
‘Azrā’īl (the angel of death).’ Being such, what on earth
is he to do, unless he kill some one?”</p>

<p>This repartee so pleased the Perwāna, that he pardoned
the culprit, and paid himself to the heirs of the slain man
the price of his blood.</p>


<h4>41.</h4>

<p>Jelāl one day went forth and preached in the market.
Crowds collected round him. But he continued until
night fell around him; so he was at length left alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>The dogs of the market-place now collected in a circle
about him, wagging their tails and whining.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Jelāl exclaimed: “By the Lord, the Highest,
the Strongest, the All-Compelling One, besides whom none
is high, or strong, or powerful! These dogs comprehend
my discourse, and the truths I expound. Men call them
dogs; but henceforward let them not be so termed. They
are of the family of the ‘<i>Seven Sleepers</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>


<h4>42.</h4>

<p>The Perwāna much wished Jelāl to give him private
instruction at his palace; and requested Jelāl’s son,
Sultan Veled, to intercede for him in the matter; which
he did.</p>

<p>Jelāl replied to his son: “Bahā’u-’d-Dīn! He cannot
bear that burden.” This was thrice repeated. Jelāl then
remarked to his son: “Bahā’u-’d-Dīn! A bucket, the water
of which is enough for forty, cannot be drained by one.”</p>

<p>Bahā made the reflection: “Had I not pressed the
matter, I had never heard this wonderful saying.”</p>


<h4>43.</h4>

<p>At another time, the Perwāna, through Bahā’u-’d-Dīn,
requested Jelāl to give a public lecture to all the men of
science of the city, who were desirous to hear him.</p>

<p>His answer was: “A tree laden with fruit, had its
branches bowed down to the earth therewith. At the
time, doubts and gainsayings prevented the gardeners
from gathering and enjoying the fruit. The tree has now
raised its head to the skies, and beyond. Can they hope,
then, to pluck and eat of its fruit?”</p>

<h4>44.</h4>

<p>Again, the Perwāna requested Jelāl himself to instruct
him and give him counsel.</p>

<p>After a little reflection, Jelāl said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> “I have heard that
thou hast committed the Qur’ān to memory. Is it so?”
“I have.” “I have heard that thou hast studied, under
a great teacher, the Jāmi’u-’l-Usūl, that mighty work on
the ‘Elements of Jurisprudence.’ Is it so?” “It is.”</p>

<p>“Then,” answered Jelāl, “thou knowest the Word of
God, and thou knowest all the words and acts reported of
His Apostle. But thou settest them at naught, and actest
not up to their precepts. How, then, canst thou expect
that words of mine will profit thee?”</p>

<p>The Perwāna was abashed, and burst into tears. He
went his way; but from that day he began to execute
justice, so as to become a rival of the great Chosroes. He
made himself the phœnix of the age, and Jelāl accepted
him as a disciple.</p>


<h4>45.</h4>

<p>A company of pilgrims arrived one year at Qonya from
Mekka, on their way home elsewhere. They were taken
in succession to visit all the chief men of rank and learning
in the capital, and were received with every demonstration
of respect.</p>

<p>At last they were conducted to Jelāl also, in his college.
On seeing him seated there, they all screamed out and
fainted away.</p>

<p>When they were recovered, Jelāl began to offer excuses,
saying to them: “I fear you have been deceived, either by
an impostor, or by some person resembling me in feature.
There are men who strongly resemble one another.”</p>

<p>The pilgrims one and all objected:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> “Why talks he thus?
Why strive to make us doubt our eyes? By the God of
heaven and earth, he was with us in person, habited in
the very dress he now wears, when we all assumed the
pilgrim garb at Mekka. He performed with us all the
ceremonies of the pilgrimage, there and at ‘Arafāt.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> He
visited with us the tomb of the Prophet at Medīna; though
he never once ate or drank with us. Now he pretends that
he does not know us or we know him.”</p>

<p>On hearing this declaration, Jelāl’s disciples were transported
with joy, a musical festival ensued, and all those
pilgrims became disciples.</p>


<h4>46.</h4>

<p>A certain rich merchant of Qonya, a disciple, as was his
wife, of Jelāl’s, went to Mekka one year for the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>On the day when the victims are slaughtered, the lady
had a dish of sweetmeat prepared, and sent some of it in
a china bowl to Jelāl, to be eaten at dinner. She made
the request that, when he partook of the food, he would
favour her absent husband with his remembrance, his
prayers, and his blessing.</p>

<p>Jelāl invited his disciples to the feast; and all ate of
the lady’s sweetmeat to repletion. But the bowl still remained
full.</p>

<p>Jelāl then said: “Oh, he too must partake of it.” He
took the bowl, ascended to the terraced roof of the college
with it, returning immediately empty-handed. His friends
asked him what he had done with the bowl and the food.
“I have handed them,” said Jelāl, “to her husband, whose
property they are.” The company remained bewildered.</p>

<p>In due course of time, the pilgrims from Qonya returned
home from Mekka; and out of the baggage of the merchant,
the china bowl was produced, and sent in to the lady, who
was much astonished at sight of it. She inquired of her
husband how he had become possessed of that identical
dish. He replied: “Ah! I also am at a loss to know
how it happened. But, on the eve of the slaughter of the
victims, I was seated in my tent, at ‘Arafāt, with a company
of other pilgrims, when an arm projected into the
tent, and placed this dish before me, filled with sweetmeat.
I sent out servants to see who had brought it to
me; but no one was found.” The lady at once inferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the truth, and guessed what had happened. Her husband
was more and more astonished at such miraculous
power.</p>

<p>Next day, husband and wife went to Jelāl, stood bare-headed
before him, wept for joy, and related what had
occurred. He answered:</p>

<p>“The whole thing is the effect of your trust and belief.
God has merely made use of my hand as the instrument
wherewith to make manifest His power.”</p>


<h4>47.</h4>

<p>Jelāl was accustomed to go every year for about six
weeks to a place near Qonya, called “<i>The Hot Waters</i>,”
where there is a lake or marsh inhabited by a large colony
of frogs.</p>

<p>A religious musical festival was arranged one day near
the lake, and Jelāl delivered a discourse. The frogs were
vociferous, and made his words inaudible. He therefore
addressed himself to them, with a loud shout, saying:
“What is all this noise about? Either do you pronounce
a discourse, or allow me to speak.” Complete silence immediately
ensued; nor was a frog ever once heard to croak
again, so long as Jelāl remained there.</p>

<p>Before leaving, he went to the marsh, and gave them his
permission to croak again now as much as they pleased.
The chorus instantly began. Numbers of people, who were
witnesses of this miraculous power over the frogs, became
believers in Jelāl, and professed themselves his disciples.</p>


<h4>48.</h4>

<p>A party of butchers had purchased a heifer, and were
leading her away to be slaughtered, when she broke loose
from them, and ran away, a crowd following and shouting
after her, so that she became furious, and none could pass
near her.</p>

<p>By chance Jelāl met her, his followers being at some
distance behind. On beholding him, the heifer became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
calm and quiet, came gently towards him, and then stood
still, as though communing with him mutely, heart to
heart, as is the wont with saints; and as though pleading
for her life. Jelāl patted and caressed her.</p>

<p>The butchers now came up. Jelāl begged of them the
animal’s life, as having placed herself under his protection.
They gave their consent, and let her go free.</p>

<p>Jelāl’s disciples now joined the party, and he improved
the occasion by the following remarks:—“If a brute beast,
on being led away to slaughter, break loose and take
refuge with me, so that God grants it immunity for my
sake, how much more so would the case be, when a human
being turns unto God with all his heart and soul, devoutly
seeking Him. God will certainly save such a man from
the tormenting demons of hell-fire, and lead him to heaven,
there to dwell eternally.”</p>

<p>Those words caused such joy and gladness among the
disciples that a musical festival, with dancing, at once
commenced, and was carried on into the night. Alms
and clothing were distributed to the poor singers of the
chorus.</p>

<p>It is related that the heifer was never seen again in the
meadows of Qonya.</p>


<h4>49.</h4>

<p>A meeting was held at the Perwāna’s palace, each guest
bringing his own waxlight of about four or five pounds’
weight. Jelāl came to the assembly with a small wax-taper.</p>

<p>The grandees smiled at the taper. Jelāl, however, told
them that their imposing candles depended on his taper
for their light. Their looks expressed their incredulity
at this. Jelāl, therefore, blew out his taper, and all the
candles were at once extinguished; the company being
left in darkness.</p>

<p>After a short interval, Jelāl fetched a sigh. His taper
took fire therefrom, and the candles all burnt brightly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
before. Numerous were the conversions resulting from
this miraculous display.</p>


<h4>50.</h4>

<p>One day, the poet-laureate, Qāni’ī, came to visit Jelāl at
his college. He was the very Khāqānī<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> of the age, and
was accompanied by a crowd of noble admirers.</p>

<p>After much conversation, Qāni’ī remarked that he did
not like the writings of the poet Sanā’ī,<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and Jelāl inquired
the reason. The poet-laureate replied: “Sanā’ī was not
a Muslim.” Again Jelāl asked why he had formed that
opinion; and Qāni’ī replied: “He has quoted passages
from the Qur’ān in his poetry, and has even used them as
his rhymes.”</p>

<p>Jelāl hereupon rebuked him most severely, as follows:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>
<p>“Do hold thy peace. What sort of a Muslim art thou?
Could a Muslim perceive the grandeur of that poet, his
hair would stand on end, and his turban would fall from
his head. That Muslim, and thousands such as he,&mdash;such
as thee,&mdash;out of this lower world, and out of the land of
spirits, would become real Muslims. His poetry, which
is an exposition of the mysteries of the Qur’ān, is so beautifully
embellished, that one may apply to it the adage:
‘We have drawn from the ocean, and we have poured
out again into the ocean.’ Thou hast not understood
his philosophy; thou hast not studied it; for thou art
a Qāni’ī (Follower of one who is satisfied). The vicars
of God have a technology, of which the rhetoricians have
no knowledge. Hence these truths appear to be imperfect,
because men of crude minds are prevented from comprehending
them. Though thou hast no part in the lot of
the recondite mysteries of the saints, it does not thence
follow that thou shouldest deny their position, and so
place thyself in a position where destruction may be
brought down upon thee. On the contrary, shouldest
thou fix thy faith upon them, and act with true sincerity,
thou shalt find in the day of judgment no heavy burden
on thy shoulders. In lieu thereof, a burden-bearer will
be present at thy side,&mdash;a refuge, who will prove thy
most earnest intercessor.”</p>

<p>Struck with these words, the poet-laureate arose, uncovered,
begged forgiveness, confessed contrition for his
disrespect, and became one of Jelāl’s disciples.</p>


<h4>51.</h4>

<p>A disciple of Husāmu-’d-Dīn wished to make a vow
never to do an act not expressly authorised by the Canon
Law of Islām. For the purpose of administering the oath
to him, instead of the Qur’ān, a copy of the Ilāhī-nāma
(Divine Hymns) of the philosopher Sanā’ī was placed on
a lectern, covered over with a cloth, and tendered as “the
Book” on which he was to swear.</p>

<p>Just then, Jelāl came into the room, and asked what
was going on. Husām replied: “One of my disciples is
going to make a vow against backsliding. We shrank
from swearing him on the Qur’ān, and have therefore prepared
a copy of the Ilāhī-nāma for the occasion.”</p>

<p>Jelāl observed: “Indeed! Why, the Ilāhī-nāma would
draw down on a forswearer a more severe chastisement
than the Qur’ān itself. The Word of God is but milk, of
which the Ilāhī-nāma is the cream and the butter!”</p>


<h4>52.</h4>

<p>When Adam was created, God commanded Gabriel to
take the three most precious pearls of the divine treasury,
and offer them in a golden salver to Adam, to choose for
himself one of the three.</p>

<p>The three pearls were: <i>wisdom</i>, <i>faith</i>, and <i>modesty</i>.</p>

<p>Adam chose the pearl of <i>wisdom</i>.</p>

<p>Gabriel then proceeded to remove the salver with the
remaining two pearls, in order to replace them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
divine treasury. With all his mighty power, he found
he could not lift the salver.</p>

<p>The two pearls said to him: “We will not separate
from our beloved wisdom. We could not be happy and
quiet away from it. From all eternity, we three have
been the three compeers of God’s glory, the pearls of His
power. We cannot be separated.”</p>

<p>A voice was now heard to proceed from the divine
presence, saying: “Gabriel! leave them, and come away.”</p>

<p>From that time, wisdom has taken its seat on the summit
of the brain of Adam; faith took up its abode in
his heart; modesty established itself in his countenance.
Those three pearls have remained as the heirlooms of
the chosen children of Adam. For, whoever, of all his
descendants, is not embellished and enriched with those
three jewels, is lacking of the sentiment and lustre of his
divine origin.</p>

<p>So runs the narrative reported by Husām, Jelāl’s successor,
as having been imparted to him by the latter.</p>


<h4>53.</h4>

<p>A certain flute-player named Hamza, much beloved by
Jelāl, happened to die. Jelāl sent some of his disciples to
array the defunct in his grave-clothes. He himself followed
them to the house of the deceased.</p>

<p>On entering the room, Jelāl addresses the dead body:
“My dear friend Hamza, arise!” Instantly, the deceased
arose, saying: “Lo, here I am!” He then took his flute,
and for three whole days and nights a religious festival was
kept up in his house.</p>

<p>Above a hundred Roman misbelievers were thereby converted
to the faith of Islām. When Jelāl left the house,
life departed from the corpse also.</p>


<h4>54.</h4>

<p>Among the disciples there was a hunchback, a devout
man, and a player on the tambourine, whom Jelāl loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>On the occasion of a festival, this poor man beat his
tambourine and shouted in ecstasy to an unusual degree.
Jelāl was also greatly moved in the spirit with the holy dance.</p>

<p>Approaching the hunchback, he said to him: “Why
erectest thou not thyself like the rest?” The infirmity
of the hunch was pleaded. Jelāl then patted him on the
back, and stroked him down. The poor man immediately
arose, erect and graceful as a cypress.</p>

<p>When he went home, his wife refused him admittance,
denying that he was her husband. His companions came,
and bare witness to her of what had happened. Then she
was convinced, let him in, and the couple lived together
for many years afterwards.</p>


<h4>55.</h4>

<p>It was once remarked to Jelāl, with respect to the burial
service for the dead, that, from the earliest times, it had
been usual for certain prayers and Qur’ānic recitations to be
said at the grave and round the corpse; but, that people
could not understand why he had introduced into the
ceremony the practice of singing hymns during the procession
towards the place of burial, which canonists had
pronounced to be a mischievous innovation.</p>

<p>Jelāl replied: “The ordinary reciters, by their services,
bear witness that the deceased lived a Muslim. My
singers, however, testify that he was a Muslim, a believer
and a lover of God.”</p>

<p>He added also:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> “Besides that; when the human spirit,
after years of imprisonment in the cage and dungeon of
the body, is at length set free, and wings its flight to the
source whence it came, is not this an occasion for rejoicings,
thanks, and dancings? The soul, in ecstasy, soars to the
presence of the Eternal; and stirs up others to make proof
of courage and self-sacrifice. If a prisoner be released
from a dungeon and be clothed with honour, who would
doubt that rejoicings are proper? So, too, the death of a
saint is an exactly parallel case.”</p>


<h4>56.</h4>

<p>One of Jelāl’s chief disciples related that, when he first
began to study under that teacher, a company of pilgrims
from Mekka came to Qonya, and among them was a very
handsome young man of this latter city, son to one of the
chief professors there.</p>

<p>This young man brought rich presents to Jelāl, and
gifts for the disciples, relating to the latter the following
adventure:—</p>

<p>“We were travelling in the desert of Arabia, and I
chanced to fall asleep. The caravan went on without
me. When I awoke, I found myself alone in the trackless
sands. I knew not which way to turn. I wept and
lamented for a considerable time, took a direction at
hazard, and walked until I was thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<p>“To my surprise and joy I espied a large tent at a
distance, with a great smoke rising by it. I made for
the tent, and there encountered a most formidable-looking
personage, to whom I related my misadventure. He bid
me welcome, asked me in, and invited me to rest myself.
Within the tent I observed a large kettle, full of fresh-cooked
sweetmeat of the finest kind, and a plentiful supply
of cool clear water.</p>

<p>“My wonder was great. I asked my host what these
preparations might mean, and he answered: ‘I am a disciple
of the great Jelālu-’d-Dīn of Qonya, son of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn
of Balkh. He is used to pass by here every day.
I have therefore pitched this tent for him, and I prepare
this food. Perchance, he may honour and bless me with
his presence, partaking of hospitality here.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>
<p>“As he yet spake, in walked Jelāl. We saluted; and
he was begged to partake of the food. He took a little
morsel, no larger than a filbert, giving me some also. I
fell at his feet, and told him I was from Qonya on
pilgrimage, and had missed the caravan by falling asleep.
‘Well,’ answered he, ‘as we are fellow-townsmen, be of
good cheer.’ He then bade me close my eyes. I did so;
and on opening them again I found myself in the midst
of my companions of the caravan. I am now come here,
on my return home in safety, to offer my thanks for that
miraculous kindness, and to profess myself a disciple of
the holy man.”</p>


<h4>57.</h4>

<p>A man of great learning came once to visit Jelāl. By
way of a test, he asked Jelāl two questions: “Is it correct
to speak of God as ‘<i>a living soul</i>?’ since God hath said
(Qur’ān iii. 182): ‘Every living soul shall taste death!’”
and: “If one ought not to call God ‘a living soul,’ what
did Jesus mean when he said (Qur’ān v. 116): ‛Thou
knowest what is in my soul, but I know not what is in
Thy soul’?” The second question was: “Can God
properly be called ‘a thing’? If He can be so called,
what is the signification of His word (Qur’ān xxviii. 88):
‘Every thing shall perish, save His cause’?”</p>

<p>Jelāl immediately replied: “‘But I know not what is in
Thy soul’ means <i>in Thy knowledge</i>, <i>in Thy absentness</i>, or,
as we seers say, <i>in Thy secrecy</i>. Thus the passage would
be paraphrased: <i>Thou knowest what is in my secrecy; but I
know not what is in the secret of Thy secrecy</i>; or, as ‘<i>the
people of heart</i>’ would put it: <i>Thou knowest what issues from
me in the world; but I know not the secret of what issues
from Thee in the world to come.</i> It is quite proper to speak
of God as ‘a thing;’ for He hath said (Qur’ān vi. 19):
‘What thing is greatest in testimony? Say thou: “God;“’
<i>i.e.</i>, God is the greatest thing in testimony; ‘God will be
a witness between me and you in the day of the resurrection.’
The signification of the passage ‘Every thing shall
perish’ is: <i>every created thing shall perish</i>; not the Creator,
<i>i.e.</i>, ‘save He.’ The thing excepted from the general
category is ‘He.’ But God knows best.”</p>

<p>The man of learning instantly professed himself a disciple,
and composed a panegyric on Jelāl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>


<h4>58.</h4>

<p>The legend goes that Jelāl made a practice of seeing the
new moon of the Arabian new year, and always uttered
the following prayer on seeing it:—“O our Lord God!
Thou art the Past-eternal One, the Future-eternal One,
the Ancient One! This is a new year. I beg of Thee
therein steadfastness to withstand the lapidated Satan,<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
and assistance against the rebellious spirit (within me);
also, occupation in what will approximate me to Thee,
and an avoidance of what might elongate me from Thee.
O God! O the All-merciful One, the All-compassionate
One! Through Thy mercy, O Most-compassionate of the
merciful ones! O thou Lord of majesty and of honour!”</p>


<h4>59.</h4>

<p>It is related that Jelāl cured one of his disciples of an
intermittent fever by writing down the following invocation
on paper, washing off the ink in water, and giving
this to the patient to drink; who was, under God’s favour,
immediately relieved from the malady:—“O Mother of the
sleek one (a nickname of the tertian ague)! If thou
hast believed in God, the Most Great, make not the head
to ache; vitiate not the swallow; eat not the flesh; drink
not the blood; and depart thou out of So-and-So, betaking
thyself to some one who attributes to God partners of
other false gods. And I bear witness that there is not
any god save God, and I testify that Muhammed is His
servant and apostle.”</p>


<h4>60.</h4>

<p>One day Jelāl paid a visit to a great Sheykh. He was
received with the utmost respect, and seated with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Sheykh on the same carpet, both together falling into
ecstatic heart-communion with the world of spirits.</p>

<p>A certain dervish was there present also, who had repeatedly
performed the pilgrimage at Mekka. The dervish
addressed Jelāl, and inquired: “What is poverty?” Jelāl
returned no answer; and the question was thrice repeated.</p>

<p>When Jelāl took his leave, the great Sheykh accompanied
him to the street door. On his return to his room,
he reprimanded the dervish severely for his insolent intrusion
on the guest; “especially,” said the Sheykh, “as he
fully answered thy question the first time thou puttest it.”
The dervish, surprised, asked what the answer had been.
“The poor man,” said the Sheykh, “when he hath known
God, hath his tongue tied. That is being a real dervish;
who, when in the presence of saints, speaks not; neither
with the tongue, nor with the heart. This is what is signified
by (Qur’ān xlvi. 28): ‘Hold ye your peace.’ But
now, prepare thyself for thy end. Thou art struck by a
shaft from heaven.”</p>

<p>Three days later, the dervish was met by a gang of
reprobates, who attacked and killed him, carrying off every
thing he had about him. <i>Salve fac nos, Domine!</i></p>


<h4>61.</h4>

<p>In the days of Jelāl there was in Qonya a lady-saint,
named Fakhru-’n-Nisā (the Glory of Women). She was
known to all the holy men of the time, who were all
aware of her sanctity. Miracles were wrought by her in
countless numbers. She constantly attended the meetings
at Jelāl’s home, and he occasionally paid her a visit
at her house.</p>

<p>Her friends suggested to her that she ought to go and
perform the pilgrimage at Mekka; but she would not
undertake this duty unless she should first consult with
Jelāl about it. Accordingly she went to see him. As she
entered his presence, before she spoke, he called out to
her:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> “Oh, most happy idea! May thy journey be prosperous!
God willing, we shall be together.” She bowed, but
said nothing. The disciples present were puzzled.</p>

<p>That night she remained a guest at Jelāl’s house, conversing
with him till past midnight. At that hour he
went up to the terraced roof of the college to perform the
divine service of the vigil. When he had completed that
service of worship, he fell into an ecstasy, shouting and
exclaiming. Then he lifted the skylight of the room
below, where the lady was, and invited her to come up on
to the roof also.</p>

<p>When she was come, he told her to look upwards, saying
that her wish was come to pass. On looking up, she
beheld the Cubical House of Mekka in the air, circumambulating
round Jelāl’s head above him, and spinning round
like a dervish in his waltz, plainly and distinctly, so as to
leave no room for doubt or uncertainty. She screamed
out with astonishment and fright, swooning away. On
coming to herself, she felt the conviction that the journey
to Mekka was not one for her to perform; so she totally
relinquished the idea.</p>


<h4>62.</h4>

<p>Jelāl was once standing at the edge of the moat round
the city of Qonya, when a company of students, undergraduates
of one of the colleges in the neighbourhood,
seeing him, agreed to try him by asking the question:
“Of what colour was the dog of the Seven Sleepers?”</p>

<p>Jelāl’s immediate, unpremeditated answer was: “Yellow.
A lover is always yellow (sallow); as am I; and
that dog was a lover.” The students bowed to him, and
all became disciples.</p>


<h4>63.</h4>

<p>The Superior of the monks of the monastery of Plato
was an old man, and was held in the very highest esteem
for his learning in all Constantinople and Firengistān, in
Sīs, Jānik, and other lands. (Sīs was capital of the king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>dom
of Lower Armenia, and Jānik was the secondary
“Roman Empire” of Trebizond.) From all those lands
did disciples flock to learn wisdom from him.</p>

<p>This Superior related the following anecdote:—</p>

<p>“One day, Jelāl came to the monastery of Plato, situated
at the foot of a hill, with a cavern therein, from whence
issued a stream of cold water. Jelāl entered the cavern,
and proceeded to its farther extremity. The Superior
remained at the cavern’s mouth, watching for what might
happen. For seven whole days and nights Jelāl remained
there, seated in the midst of the cold water. At the end
of that period he came forth from the cavern, and walked
away, singing a hymn. Not the slightest change was
apparent in his features, nor in his eyes.”</p>

<p>The Superior made oath that all he had read about the
person and qualities of the Messiah, as also in the books
of Abraham and Moses, were found in the person of Jelāl,
as well as the grandeur and mien of the prophets, as set
forth in books of ancient history, and far more besides.</p>


<h4>64.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz once asserted, in Jelāl’s college,
that whosoever wished to see again the prophets, had only
to look on Jelāl, who possessed all their qualifications;
more especially of those to whom revelations were made,
whether by angelic communications, or whether in visions;
the chief of such qualities being serenity of mind with
perfect inward confidence and consciousness of being one
of God’s elect. “Now,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> “to possess Jelāl’s approbation
is heaven; while hell is to incur his displeasure.
Jelāl is the key of heaven. Go then, and look upon Jelāl,
if thou wish to comprehend the signification of that saying
‘<i>the learned are the heirs of the prophets</i>,’ together with
something beyond that, which I will not here specify.
He has more learning in every science than any one else
upon earth. He explains better, with greater tact and
taste, as also more exhaustively, than all others. Were I,
with my mere intellect, to study for a hundred years, I
could not acquire a tenth part of what he knows. He has
intuitively thought out that knowledge, without being
aware of it, in my presence, by his own subtlety.”</p>


<h4>65.</h4>

<p>One of the greatest teachers of Qonya was one day
giving a lecture on a terraced roof, when suddenly he
heard the sound of a lute. He exclaimed: “These lutes
are an innovation on the prophetic usages. They must
be interdicted.”</p>

<p>Forthwith, the form of Jelāl appeared before him, and
answered: “That must not be.” On this the teacher
fainted away.</p>

<p>When he regained his consciousness, he sought to make
his peace with Jelāl, by sending an apology and a recantation
to him, through the medium of Jelāl’s son, Sultan
Veled; but Jelāl would not accept them. He answered:
“It would be easier to convert seventy Roman bishops to
Islām, than to clear away from the mind of that teacher
the stains of hate, and so set him on the right road. His
soul is as foul as the paper on which children practise
their writing exercises.”</p>

<p>At length, however, he allowed himself to be appeased
by his son; so that he permitted the teacher, with his
pupils, to constitute themselves his disciples.</p>


<h4>66.</h4>

<p>Jelāl one day addressed his son, saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> “Bahā’u-’d-Dīn,
dost thou wish to love thy enemy, and to be loved of him?
Speak well of him, and extol his virtues. He will then
be thy friend; and for this reason: In like manner as
there is a road open between the heart and the tongue, so
also is there a way from the tongue to the heart. The
love of God may be found by hearing His <i>comely names</i>.
God hath said: ‘O My servants, take ye heed that ye
often commemorate Me, so that sincerity may abound.’
The more that sincerity prevails, the more do the rays
of the light of truth shine into the heart. The hotter a
baker’s oven is, the more bread will it bake; if cool, it
will not bake at all.”</p>


<h4>67.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled, Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, is said to have recounted
of his father, Jelāl, this saying: “A true disciple is he
who holds his teacher to be superior to all others. So
much so, that, for instance, a disciple of Bāyezīd of Bestām
was once asked whether Bāyezīd or Abū-Hanīfa was the
greater, and he replied that his teacher, Bāyezīd, was the
greater. ‘Then,’ said the questioner, ‘is Bāyezīd the
greater, or is Abū-Bekr?’ ‘My teacher is the greater.’
‘Bāyezīd or Muhammed?’ ‘Bāyezīd.’ ‘Bāyezīd or God?’
‘I only know my teacher; I know no other than him;
and I know that he is greater than all others.’</p>

<p>“Another was asked the last question, and his reply
was: ‘There is no difference between the two.’ A third
was asked it also, and he replied: ‘It would require a
greater one than either of the two to determine which
of them is the greater.’</p>

<p>“As God does not walk in this world of sensible objects,
the prophets are the substitutes of God. No, no! I
am wrong! For if thou suppose that those substitutes
and their principal are two different things, thou hast
judged erroneously, not rightly.”</p>


<h4>68.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled is reported to have said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> “My grandfather,
the Great Master, used to recommend to his disciples to
honour his son Jelāl exceedingly, as one of noble extraction
and exalted pedigree, of an eternal descent in the past;
since the mother of his mother was the daughter of the
Imām Sarakhsī, a descendant from Huseyn, son of ‘Alī,
and grandson of the Prophet.”</p>


<h4>69.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled is also reported to have said: “My father
told his disciples that I was seven, and my brother ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn
eight years old, when the Dizdār Bedru-’d-Dīn
Guhertāsh had us circumcised at Qara-Hisār.” (See chap.
i., No. 12.)</p>

<p>He is also reported to have declared: “When the Sultan
invited my grandfather to Qonya, a year passed, and then
the Emīr Mūsa invited my grandfather to Larenda, and
took my father to be his own son-in-law; so that I was
born in that town.” (See chap. i., No. 2. The account
now given here is at variance with that mentioned in the
preface, which makes ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn and Bahā’u-’d-Dīn to
have been born at Larenda before Jelāl and his father
went to Qonya. Moreover, their mother, Gevher Khātūn,
is there said to have been the daughter of Lala Sherefu-’d-Dīn
of Samarqand. Is that an alias of the Emīr Mūsa of
the present anecdote; or did Jelāl marry two ladies of
Larenda at different times? There are several difficulties
here. Sultan Veled puts only one year as the difference
of age between himself and his elder brother. If the
daughter of the Emīr Mūsa was the mother of both these
brothers, Jelāl’s stay at Larenda must have been of about
two years at least. If they were by different mothers,
and born, the one before, the other after Bahā Veled’s
settling at Qonya, there must have been a greater difference
in their ages. Jelāl’s age at his marriage is also variously
stated. These discrepancies show that the anecdotes were
collected from traditions of various sources, long after the
events recorded.)</p>


<h4>70.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled is said to have related that one day, two
Turks, law-students, brought to Jelāl an offering of a few
lentils, excusing the paucity of the gift, as the result of their
poverty. Jelāl thereupon narrated the following anecdote:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>“God revealed to Mustafa (Muhammed) that the believers
should contribute of their possessions, for the service of
God, as much as they could spare. Some brought the
half, some the third part; Abū-Bekr brought the whole
of what he possessed. Thus a large treasure was collected,
of money, beasts, and arms, for God’s service.</p>

<p>“A poor woman, too, brought three dates and a cake of
bread&mdash;all she had on earth.</p>

<p>“The disciples smiled. Mustafa perceived their action,
and said that God had showed him a vision, which he
desired to tell to them. They all begged he would favour
them with the recital. He therefore thus proceeded:</p>

<p>“‘God hath removed the veils from before me. And lo,
I saw that the angels had placed in one scale of a balance
the whole of your very liberal offerings together, and in
the other scale the three dates and one cake of this poor
woman. The latter scale was preponderant; its contents
outweighed all the rest.’</p>

<p>“The disciples bowed, thanked the prophet, and inquired
the hidden explanation of this mystery. He
answered: ‘This poor woman has parted with her all,
whereas my disciples have kept back a part of their
possessions. Proverbs say: “The generous one is generous
out of what he possesses,” and, “A little, in the eyes of
the Most Great, is much.” You put into the earth a
single date-stone, intrusting it to God. He makes that
stone become a tree, which yields fruits without number;
because the stone was confided to Him. Therefore, let
your alms be given to the poor, and to God’s servants, as
a trust committed unto God. For it is said: “Alms fall
first into God’s hand, before reaching the hands of the
poor;” and again: “Alms for the poor and the destitute.”’</p>

<p>“The poor of Mekka and Medīna, refugees and
auxiliaries, shouted their admiration as they heard these
words.”</p>

<p>When the two Turkish students heard this anecdote
related, they professed themselves disciples of Jelāl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>


<h4>71.</h4>

<p>When Jelāl was quite young, he was one day preaching
on the subject of Moses and Elias (Qur’ān xviii. 59-81).
One of his disciples noticed a stranger seated in a corner,
paying great attention, and every now and then saying:
“Good! Quite true! Quite correct! He might have
been the third one with us two!” The disciple surmised
that the stranger might be Elias. (Elias is believed by
Muslims to be always visible somewhere, but that people
know him not. Did they recognise him, they could obtain
from him a knowledge of the secret of eternal life, which
he possesses.) He therefore seized hold of the stranger’s
skirt, and asked for his spiritual aid. “Oh,” said the
stranger, “rather seek assistance from Jelāl, as we all do.
Every occult saint of God is the loving and admiring
friend of him.” So saying, he managed to disengage his
skirt from the disciple’s hold, and instantly disappeared.
The disciple went to pay his respects to Jelāl, who at once
addressed him, saying: “Elias, and Moses, and the prophets,
are all friends of mine.” The disciple understood
the allusion, and became more and more devoted at heart
to Jelāl than he even was before.</p>


<h4>72.</h4>

<p>It is related that when the burial service was about to
be performed over the corpse of Jelāl, the precentor gave
a shriek, and swooned away. After a while, he recovered,
and then performed his office, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>On being asked the cause of his emotion, he answered:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
“As I stood forward to perform my office, I perceived a
row of the most noble of spiritual saints of the spiritual
world, as being present, and as being engaged in reciting
the prayers for the dead over the departed one. Those
angels of heaven wore robes of blue (the mourning of some
sects of Muslims), and wept.”</p>

<p>For forty days, that precentor and others daily visited
Jelāl’s grave.</p>


<h4>73.</h4>

<p>At Damascus, when a young student, Jelāl was frequently
seen by others to walk several arrow-flights’
distance in the air, tranquilly returning to the terraced
roof on which they were standing.</p>

<p>Those fellow-pupils were among his earliest believers
and disciples.</p>


<h4>74.</h4>

<p>A friend of Jelāl’s once took leave of him at Qonya, and
went to Damascus. On his arrival there, he found Jelāl
seated in a corner of his room. Asking for an explanation
of this surprising phenomenon, Jelāl replied: “The men
of God are like fishes in the ocean; they pop up into view
on the surface here and there and everywhere, as they
please.”</p>


<h4>75.</h4>

<p>Jelāl once met a Turk in Qonya, who was selling fox-skins
in the market, and crying them: “Dilku! Dilku!”
(Fox! Fox! in Turkish.)</p>

<p>Jelāl immediately began to parody his cry, calling out
in Persian: “Dil kū! Dil kū!” (Heart, where art thou?)
At the same time he broke out into one of his holy waltzes
of ecstasy.</p>


<h4>76.</h4>

<p>In the time of Sultan Veled (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1284-1312), a young
man, of the descendants of the Prophet, and son of the
guardian of the holy tomb of Muhammed at Medīna, came
to Qonya with a company of his fellow-descendants, belonging
to that city. He was presented to Sultan Veled,
and became his disciple.</p>

<p>He wore a most singular head-dress. One end of his
turban hung down in front to below his navel; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
other end was formed into the <i>sheker-āvīz</i><a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> of the Mevlevī
dervishes.</p>

<p>When they had become somewhat intimate, Sultan Veled
asked him how it happened that he wore the <i>sheker-āvīz</i> of
the Mevlevis, when nobody else but those dervishes wear
it, in imitation of their founder, Jelāl.</p>

<p>The young man explained that his family were descended
from the Prophet. That the Prophet, on the night of his
ascension to heaven, after seeing God and many mysteries,
had returned a certain distance, and, as is well known, then
went back to intercede with God for his people. He now
perceived, on the pinnacle of God’s throne, the ideal
portrait of a form, so beautiful, that he had not hitherto
witnessed anything so charming among the angels and
inhabitants of heaven.</p>

<p>After contemplating the lovely vision, in amazement, for
some time, Muhammed was able to notice that the ideal
form wore on its head a <i>sheker-āvīz</i>. He asked Gabriel
what that ideal portrait might portend, which was so
attractive in its beauty as to surpass all the wonders he
had witnessed in all the nine heavens. “Is it the portrait
of an angel, a prophet, or a saint?” Gabriel replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> “It
is the portrait of a personage of the descendants of Abū-Bekr,
who will appear in the latter days among the people
of thy Church, and will fill the whole world with the
effulgence of the knowledge of thy mysteries. To him
will God vouchsafe a precedency, and a pen, and a breath,
such that kings and princes will profess themselves his
disciples; and he will be a most pure upholder of thy
religion, being, in every respect, the counterpart of thyself
in aspect and in morals. His name will be Muhammed,
as is thine; and his surname will be Jelālu-’d-Dīn. His
words will explain thy sayings, and will expound thy
Qur’ān.”</p>

<p>On his return home, the Prophet adopted the form of
turban he had seen worn in that ideal portrait, making
one end hang down a span in front, and binding the other
end behind into a <i>sheker-āvīz</i>.</p>

<p>“From that day to this,” said the young man, “the
fathers of our family have followed that fashion, so
adopted by the Prophet; and we continue to do so too.”</p>

<p>It is said that when Abū-Bekr heard this narrative from
the Prophet, respecting his great descendant that was thus
foretold, he gave the whole of his possessions to the Prophet,
to be expended in God’s cause.</p>

<p>When Muhammed died, Abū-Bekr wept long and bitterly.
But the Prophet appeared to him, and consoled
him by saying: “One day I will reappear among my people
from out of the collar of one of thy race.”</p>

<p>The young man continued: “From that time onwards,
our family were on the outlook for the manifestation of
the holy personage whose ideal portrait the Prophet so
saw. Thank God that I have witnessed the realisation of
their hope.”</p>

<p>The Qonya pilgrims published this communication to
all the disciples there present.</p>


<h4>77.</h4>

<p>In the days of Sultan Veled, a great merchant came to
Qonya to visit the tomb of Jelāl. He offered many rich
gifts to Sultan Veled, making presents also to the disciples.
He related to them many anecdotes of adventures encountered
by him in his travels, such as the following:—</p>

<p>He once went to Kīsh and Bahreyn in quest of pearls
and rubies. “An inhabitant told me,” said he, “that I
should find some in the hands of a certain fisherman. I
went to him, and the fisher showed me a chest, containing
pearls of inestimable value, such as impressed me with
astonishment. I asked him how he had collected them;
and he told me, calling God to witness, that he, his three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
brothers, and his father, were formerly poor fishermen.
One day they hooked something that gave them immense
trouble before they could bring it to land.</p>

<p>“They now found they had captured a ‘Lord of the
Waters,’ also named a ‘Marvel of the Sea,’ as is commonly
known.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>“We wondered,” said he, “what we could do with the
beast. We wept for the ill fortune that had brought us
such a disappointment. The creature looked at us as we
spoke. Suddenly my father cried out: ‘I have it! I will
put him on a cart, and exhibit him all over the country at
a penny a head!’</p>

<p>“Through the miraculous power of Him who has endowed
man with speech and His creatures with life, the
beast broke forth and exclaimed: ‘Make me not a staring-block
in the world, and I will do anything you may wish
of me, so as to suffice for you and your children for many
years to come!’</p>

<p>“Our father answered: ‘How should I set thee free,
when thou art so strange and unparalleled a creature?’
The beast replied: ‘I will make an oath.’ Our father
said: ‘Speak! Let us hear thy oath.’</p>

<p>“The beast now said: ‘We are of the faith of Muhammed,
and disciples of the holy Mevlānā. By the soul of
the Mevlānā, the holy Jelālu-’d-Dīn of Rome, I will go,
and I will return.’</p>

<p>“Our father fainted away with astonishment. I, therefore,
now asked: ‘How hast thou any knowledge of him?’
The beast replied: ‘We are a nation of twelve thousand
individuals. We have believed in him, and he frequently
showed himself to us at the bottom of the sea, lecturing
and sermonising to us on the divine mysteries of the truth.
He brought us to a knowledge of the true faith; so that
we continually practise what he taught us.’</p>

<p>“Our father instantly told him he was free. He went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
back, therefore, into the water, and was lost to sight. But
two days later he returned, and brought with him innumerable
pearls and precious stones. He asked whether
he had been true and faithful to his promise; and on our
expressing our satisfaction on that score, he took an affectionate
farewell from us.</p>

<p>“We were thus raised from the depths of poverty to
the pinnacle of wealth. We became merchant princes,
and our slaves are the great merchants of the earth. Every
dealer who wishes for pearls and rubies comes to us. We
are known as the <i>Sons of the Fisherman</i>. Our father went
to Qonya, and paid his respects to the Mevlānā.</p>

<p>“Through his narrative, I formed the design, now carried
into effect, to visit the son of that great saint.”</p>

<p>This wonderful narrative has been handed down ever
since in the mouths of the merchants of Qonya.</p>


<h4>78.</h4>

<p>(The following appears to be an account of one of the
first visits of the Perwāna to Jelāl, to whom he subsequently
became so devotedly attached.)</p>

<p>One of the most eminent among the men of learning in
Qonya was visited by the Perwāna. The learned man
held forth eloquently on several exalted themes, and then
informed the Perwāna that he had, the night before, been
taken up into the highest heaven, and had there learnt
many mysteries. He said that he there saw Jelāl hold a
higher station of proximity to God than any other saint,
as he stood on a level with God’s throne.</p>

<p>A day or two later, the Perwāna, filled with reverence
for Jelāl’s unequalled sanctity, went and paid him a visit
with the utmost deference. Before the Perwāna could
broach any subject of conversation, Jelāl said to him:
“Mu’īnu-’d-Dīn! the vision related to you by your learned
friend is quite true in the main facts, though I never saw
him there at any time.” He then extemporised the following
ode:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Fellow-visitant wert thou? Then say what thou sawest there last night.</div>
  <div class="verse">’Twixt my heart and inspiring loved darling what passed in thy sight?</div>
  <div class="verse">And if thou, in thy dream, with thy eyes sawest my beautiful love,</div>
  <div class="verse">Tell us then, in the earrings he wore there what jewels were wove.</div>
  <div class="verse">If with me thou be fellow in coat, as in thoughts and in creeds,</div>
  <div class="verse">Let us hear the details of that ragged old mendicant’s weeds.</div>
  <div class="verse">If thou poverty’s son be, and unspoken mysteries hear,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thou’lt recount all the words that were thought by my silent compeer,</div>
  <div class="verse">If thou’st learnt whence the source of mankind and of souls did proceed.</div>
  <div class="verse">Since the source was but one, what then means all this search, all this greed?</div>
  <div class="verse">And if thou hast not seen any place of his form and face free,</div>
  <div class="verse">Say then what, in the thoughts of his lovers, that face and form be.</div>
  <div class="verse">And if I head the lists of those lovers, as thou seemest to say,</div>
  <div class="verse">Tell us, What are those lists? What his messages, words, answers? Pray!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A musical service was then got up, this ode being
chanted during its performance. The Perwāna was so
utterly bewildered by this incident, that he could say
nothing. He therefore rose, bowed, and took his leave.</p>


<h4>79.</h4>

<p>One day, it is said, the Prophet (Muhammed) recited to
‘Alī in private the secrets and mysteries of the “Brethren
of Sincerity” (who appear to be the “Freemasons” of the
Muslim dervish world), enjoining on him not to divulge
them to any of the uninitiated, so that they should not be
betrayed; also, to yield obedience to the rule of implicit
submission.</p>

<p>For forty days, ‘Alī kept the secret in his own sole
breast, and bore therewith until he was sick at heart. Like
a pregnant woman, his abdomen became swollen with the
burden, so that he could no longer breathe freely.</p>

<p>He therefore fled to the open wilderness, and there
chanced upon a well. He stooped, reached his head as far
down into the well as he was able; and then, one by one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
he confided those mysteries to the bowels of the earth.
From the excess of his excitement, his mouth filled with
froth and foam. These he spat out into the water of the
well, until he had freed himself of the whole, and he felt
relieved.</p>

<p>After a certain number of days, a single reed was observed
to be growing in that well. It waxed and shot
up, until at length a youth, whose heart was miraculously
enlightened on the point, became aware of this growing
plant, cut it down, drilled holes in it, and began to play
upon it airs, similar to those performed by the dervish lovers
of God, as he pastured his sheep in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>By degrees, the various tribes of Arabs of the desert
heard of this flute-playing of the shepherd, and its fame
spread abroad. The camels and the sheep of the whole
region would gather around him as he piped, ceasing to
pasture that they might listen. From all directions, north
and south, the nomads flocked to hear his strains, going
into ecstasies with delight, weeping for joy and pleasure,
breaking forth in transports of gratification.</p>

<p>The rumour at length reached the ears of the Prophet,
who gave orders for the piper to be brought before him.
When he began to play in the sacred presence, all the holy
disciples of God’s messenger were moved to tears and
transports, bursting forth with shouts and exclamations
of pure bliss, and losing all consciousness. The Prophet
declared that the notes of the shepherd’s flute were the
interpretation of the holy mysteries he had confided in
private to ‘Alī’s charge.<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Thus it is that, until a man acquire the sincere devotion
of the linnet-voiced flute-reed, he cannot hear the mysteries
of the Brethren of Sincerity in its dulcet notes, or realise
the delights thereof; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> “faith is altogether a yearning
of the heart, and a gratification of the spiritual sense.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“To whom, alas, the pangs my love for thee excites, to breathe?</div>
  <div class="verse">My sighs, like ‘Alī, I’ll to some deep well’s recess bequeathe.</div>
  <div class="verse">Perchance some reeds may spring therefrom, its brink to overgrow;</div>
  <div class="verse">Those reeds may moaning flutes become, and so betray my woe.</div>
  <div class="verse">Who hear will say: ‘Be silent, flutes! We’re not love’s confidants;</div>
  <div class="verse">To that sweet tyrant make excuse for us and for those plants!’”</div>
</div></div></div>


<h4>80.</h4>

<p>One of Jelāl’s disciples possessed a slave girl of Roman
origin, whom Jelāl had named Siddīqa (after Muhammed’s
virgin wife ‘Ā’isha). Occasionally she had miraculous
visions. She used to see aureolas of heavenly light, green,
red, and <i>black</i>. Various of the angels used to visit her,
and souls of the departed.</p>

<p>Her master was vexed at her being so favoured above
himself. Once he was visited by Jelāl, and expressed his
chagrin to him on the subject. Jelāl replied: “True!
There is a heavenly light resides in the pupils of some eyes.
These occasionally mislead a few with visions of beauteous
form, with which they fall in love. Others they preserve
in chastity, and lead them to their adored Maker. Others,
again, they may lead to take delight in exterior objects,
so as to cast their eyes on every pretty face they see, while
the wife at home is curtained away from her husband.
Thus, whenever God opens a way to any one, appearing to
him, and showing him glimpses of the hidden world, he is
apt to become entranced therewith, and to lose all power
of further progress, saying to himself: ‘How greatly in
favour am I!’ Others, in short, use every endeavour;
but nothing is vouchsafed to them in visions, until they
be favoured with a special sight of God Himself, and they
be admitted to a near approach unto Him.”</p>

<p>The girl’s master was comforted, and bowed to his teacher,
whose disciples then broke out into a holy service of
psalmody and dancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>


<h4>81.</h4>

<p>There was once a wise monk in the monastery of Plato,
who was on very friendly terms with Jelāl’s grandson
‘Ārif. He was very aged, and used to be visited by the
dervishes of his neighbourhood, to whom he was very
polite, and towards whom he exhibited great confidence;
so much so that, one day, some of them inquired of him
how he had found Jelāl, and what he had thought of
him.</p>

<p>The monk replied to them: “What do you know of him,
as to who or what he was? I have seen signs and miracles
without number worked by him. I became his devoted
servant. I had read in the gospel and in the prophets
the lives and the works of the saints of old, and I saw
that he compassed them all. I therefore had faith in the
truth of his reality.</p>

<p>“One day he came here, conferring on me the honour
of a visit. For forty days he shut himself up in ecstatic
seclusion. When at length he came forth from his privacy,
I laid hold of his skirt, and said to him: ‘God, in His
holy scripture hath said (Qur’ān xix. 72): “And there is
none of you but shall come to it (hell-fire).” Now, since it
is incontestable that all shall come to the fire of hell, what
preference is there in Islām over our faith?’</p>

<p>“For a little time he made no answer. At length, however,
he made a sign towards the city, and went away in
that direction. I followed after him leisurely. Near the
city, we came to a bakehouse, the oven of which was being
heated. He now took my black cassock, wrapped it in
his own cloak, and threw the bundle into the oven. He
then withdrew for a time into a corner, sunk in meditation.</p>

<p>“I saw a great smoke come out of the oven, such that
no one had the power of utterance. After that, he said to
me: ‘Behold!’ The baker withdrew the bundle from the
oven, and assisted the saint to put on his cloak, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
become exquisitely clean; whereas my cassock was, as it
were, branded and scorched, so as to fall in pieces. Then
he said: ‘Thus shall we enter therein, and thus shall you
enter!’</p>

<p>“That selfsame moment I made my bow to him and
became his disciple.”</p>


<h4>82.</h4>

<p>The reason why the Mesnevī was written is related to
have been the following:—</p>

<p>Husāmu-’d-Dīn learnt that several of the followers of
Jelāl were fond of studying the Ilāhī-nāma of Sanā’ī, the
Hakīm, and the Mantiqu-’t-Tayr of ‘Attār, as also the
Nasīb-nāma of the latter.</p>

<p>He therefore sought and found an opportunity to propose
that Jelāl should indite something in the style of the
Ilāhī-nāma, but in the metre of the Mantiqu-’t-Tayr;
saying that the circle of friends would then willingly give
up all other poetry, and study that alone.</p>

<p>Jelāl immediately produced a portion of the Mesnevī,
saying that God had forewarned him of the wishes of the
brethren, in consequence of which he had already begun
to compose the work. That fragment consisted of the first
eighteen couplets of the introductory verses:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“From reed-flute hear what tale it tells,</div>
  <div class="verse">What plaint it makes of absence’ ills,” &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is of the metre <i>Remel</i>, hexameter contracted:</p>

<p>- ‿ - - │ - ‿ - - │ - ‿ - ║ - ‿ - - │ - ‿ - - │ - ‿ - ║</p>

<p>Jelāl frequently mentions Husām as the cause of the
work’s having been begun and continued. In the fourth
book he addresses him in the opening couplet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Of Truth, the light; of Faith, the sword; Husāmu-’d-Dīn aye be;</div>
  <div class="verse">Above the lunar orb has clomb my Mesnevī, through thee.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again the sixth book has for its opening verse the
following apostrophe:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“O thou, Husāmu-’d-Dīn, my heart’s true life! Zeal, for thy sake,</div>
  <div class="verse">I feel springs up in me sixth book hereby to undertake.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Often they spent whole nights at the task, Jelāl inditing,
and Husām writing down his inspirations, chanting it
aloud, as he wrote it, with his beautiful voice. Just as
the first book was completed, Husām’s wife died, and an
interval ensued.</p>

<p>Two years thus passed without progress. Husām
married again; and in that year, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 662 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1263), the
second book was commenced. No other interval occurred
until the work was brought to a conclusion. The third
couplet of the second book mentions Husām in these
terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“When thou, of Truth the light, Husāmu-’d-Dīn, thy courser’s rein</div>
  <div class="verse">Didst turn, descending earthward from the zenith’s starry plain.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The third, fifth, and seventh books have similar addresses
to Husām in their opening verses. His name is
also mentioned cursorily in the third tale of the first book.</p>


<h4>83.</h4>

<p>On the death of Jelāl, a party of zealots went in a body
to the Perwāna, explaining to him that the new practices
of music and dancing, introduced by Jelāl, were innovations
altogether contrary to the canonical institutes, and
begging him to use his utmost endeavours to suppress
them.</p>

<p>The Perwāna called on the learned Mufti of Qonya,
Sheykh Sadru-’d-Dīn, and consulted him on the subject.
The Mufti’s answer was: “Do nothing of the kind.
Listen not to such biased suggestions. There is an
apostolical saying to this effect: ‘A laudable innovation,
introduced by a perfect follower of the prophets, is of the
same nature with the customary practices of the prophets
themselves.’” The Perwāna resolved, therefore, to do
nothing towards suppressing Jelāl’s institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>


<h4>84.</h4>

<p>A certain great man, who esteemed Jelāl, was nevertheless
shocked that he should, with all his learning and
piety, sanction the use of music and dancing.</p>

<p>He had occasion to visit Jelāl, who at once addressed
him as follows:—“It is an axiom in the sacred canons that
a Muslim, if hard pressed, and in danger of death, may eat
of carrion and other forbidden food, so that the life of a
man be not sacrificed. This rule is admitted and approved
by all the authorities of the law. Now, we <i>men of God</i>
are exactly in that position of extreme danger to our
lives; and from that danger there is no escape, save by
song, by music, and by the dance. Otherwise, through
the awful majesty of the divine manifestations, the bodies
of the saints would melt away as wax, and disappear like
snow under the beams of a July sun.”</p>

<p>The personage thus addressed was so struck with the
earnestness of Jelāl’s manner, and the cogency of his
reasoning, that he became convinced, and thenceforward
was a defender and upholder of Jelāl’s institutions, so
that these formed, as it were, the very nourishment of his
heart. Many of the learned followed his example, and
joined themselves to Jelāl’s followers and disciples.</p>


<h4>85.</h4>

<p>Kālūmān and ‘Aynu-’d-Devla were two Roman painters.
They were unrivalled in their art of painting portraits and
pictures. Both were disciples of Jelāl.</p>

<p>Kālūmān one day narrated that in Constantinople, on a
certain tablet, the portraits of the Lady Meryem and of
Jesus were painted, in such style as to be matchless.
From all parts of the world artists came and tried their
best; but none could produce the equal of those two
portraits.</p>

<p>‘Aynu-’d-Devla undertook, therefore, to journey to
Constantinople, and see this picture. He made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>self
an inmate of the great church of Constantinople
for a whole year, and served the priests thereof in various
ways.</p>

<p>One night, then, he spied his opportunity, took the
tablet under his arm, and absconded with it.</p>

<p>On reaching Qonya, he paid his respects to Jelāl, who
inquired of him where he had been. He narrated to
Jelāl all that had occurred with the tablet, which he
exhibited.</p>

<p>Jelāl found the picture exceedingly beautiful, and gazed
on it long with the utmost pleasure. He then spake as
follows:—</p>

<p>“These two beautiful portraits complain of you, saying
that you are not a faithful admirer of theirs, but are an
untrue lover.” The artist asked: “How?” Jelāl replied:
“They say they are not supplied with food and rest. On
the contrary, they are kept sleepless every night, and fasting
every day. They complain: ‘Aynu-’d-Devla leaves
us, sleeps himself all night, and takes his meals by day,
never remaining with us to do as we do!’”</p>

<p>The artist remarked: “Food and sleep are to them
impossibilities. Neither have they speech, with which
to say anything. They are mere lifeless effigies.”</p>

<p>Jelāl now replied: “Thou art a living effigy. Thou
hast acquired a knowledge of various arts. Thou art the
handiwork of a limner whose hand has framed the universe,
the human race, and all things on earth and in heaven.
Is it right that thou forsake Him, and enamour thyself of
an insignificant lifeless effigy? What profit is there in
these portraits? What advantage can accrue to thee from
them?”</p>

<p>Touched by these reproaches, the artist vowed repentance
of his sin, and professed himself a Muslim.</p>


<h4>86.</h4>

<p>When the time of Jelāl’s death drew near, he cautioned
his disciples to have no fear or anxiety on that account;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
“for,” said he, “as the spirit of Mansūr<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> appeared, a
hundred and fifty years after his death, to the Sheykh
Ferīdu-’d-Dīn ‘Attār, and became the Sheykh’s spiritual
guide and teacher, so, too, do you always be with me,
whatever may happen, and remember me, so that I may
show myself to you, in whatever form that may be;&mdash;that
I may always belong to you, and ever be shedding in your
breasts the light of heavenly inspiration. I will simply
remind you now that our dear Lord, Muhammed, the
Apostle of God, said to his disciples: ‘My life is a blessing
unto you, and my death will be a blessing unto you.
In my life I have guided you, and after my death I will
send blessings on you.’”</p>

<p>Jelāl’s friends shed tears all, and broke out into sighs
and lamentations; but bowed their heads in reverence.</p>

<p>It is said that he gave directions to get ready his grave-clothes,
and that his wife, Kirā Khātūn, began to wail,
tearing her clothes, and exclaiming: “O thou light of the
world, life of the human race; unto whom wilt thou
commit us? Whither wilt thou go?”</p>

<p>He answered her: “Whither will I go? Verily, I shall
not quit your circle.” She then asked: “Will there be
another like unto thee, our Lord? Will another become
manifest?” He replied: “If there be, he will be I.”
After a while he added:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> “While in the body, I have two
attachments; one, to you; the other, to the flesh. When,
by the grace of the unique Spirit, I become disembodied,&mdash;when
the world of unbodied spirits, unity, and singleness,
shall appear, my attachment to the flesh will become
attachment to you, and I shall then have but one sole
attachment.”</p>


<h4>87.</h4>

<p>With his last breath Jelāl recommended to Husāmu-’d-Dīn
to lay him in the upper part of his tomb, so that
he might be the first to rise at the last day.</p>

<p>As he lay in his extreme sickness, there were earthquakes
for seven days and nights, very severe, so that walls
and houses were overthrown. On the seventh occasion,
all his disciples were alarmed. He, however, calmly remarked:
“Poor earth! it is eager for a fat morsel! It
shall have one!”</p>

<p>He then gave his last instructions to his disciples, as
follows:—“I recommend unto you the fear of God, in
public and in private; abstemiousness in eating and in
sleeping, as also in speaking; the avoidance of rebelliousness
and of sin; constancy in fasting, continuous worship,
and perpetual abstinence from fleshly lusts; long-suffering
under the ill-treatment of all mankind; to shun the companionship
of the light-minded and of the common herd;
to associate with the righteous and with men of worth. For
verily ‘<i>the best of mankind is he who benefiteth men</i>,’<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and
‘<i>the best of speech is that which is short and to the purpose</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>


<h4>88.</h4>

<p>The following is a prayer taught by Jelāl, on his deathbed,
to one of his friends, to be used whenever affliction
or care might weigh upon him:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>
<p>“O our Lord God, I breathe but for Thee, and I stretch
forth my spirit towards Thee, that I may recite Thy doxologies
abundantly, commemorating Thee frequently. O
our Lord God, lay not on me an ailment that may make
me forgetful to commemorate Thee, or lessen my yearning
towards Thee, or cut off the delight I experience in reciting
the litanies of Thy praise. Grant me not a health that
may engender or increase in me presumptuous or thankless
insolence. For Thy mercy’s sake, O Thou Most-Merciful
of the compassionate. Amen.”</p>


<h4>89.</h4>

<p>A friend was seated by Jelāl’s pillow, and Jelāl leaned
on that friend’s bosom. Suddenly a most handsome
youth appeared at the door of the room, to the utmost
astonishment of the friend.</p>

<p>Jelāl arose and advanced to receive the stranger. But
the friend was quicker, and quietly asked his business.
The stranger answered: “I am ‘Azrā’īl, the angel of departure
and separation. I am come, by the divine command,
to inquire what commission the Master may have to intrust
to me.”</p>

<p>Blessed are the eyes that can perceive such sights!</p>

<p>The friend was near fainting at this answer. But he
heard Jelāl call out: “Come in, come in, thou messenger
of my King. Do that which thou art bidden; and, God
willing, thou shalt find me one of the patient.”</p>

<p>He now told his attendants to bring a vessel of water,
placed his two feet therein, and occasionally sprinkled a
little on his breast and forehead, saying: “My beloved
(God) has proffered me a cup of poison (bitterness). From
his hand I drink that poison with delight.”</p>

<p>The singers and musicians now came in, and executed
a hymn, while the whole company of friends wept, and
sobbed loudly.</p>

<p>Jelāl observed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> “It is as my friends say. But, were
they even to pull down the house, what use? See my
panting heart; look at my delight. The sun sheds a
grateful light on the moth. My friends invite me one
way; my teacher Shemsu-’d-Dīn beckons me the other
way. Comply ye with the summoner of the Lord, and
have faith in Him. Departure is inevitable. All being
came out of nothing, and again it will be shut up in the
prison of nullity. Such is God’s decree from all eternity;
and, to decree belongeth unto God, the Most High, the
All-Great!”</p>

<p>His son Sultan Veled had been unremitting in his attentions.
He wept and sobbed. He was reduced to a shadow.
Jelāl therefore said to him: “Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, my son, I
am better. Go and lie down a little. Rest thyself, and
sleep awhile!”</p>

<p>When he was gone, Jelāl indited his last ode; thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Go! head on pillow lay; alone, in peace, me leave,</div>
  <div class="verse">Loved tyrant, plague by night, while all around thee grieve.</div>
  <div class="verse">That peerless beauty (God) has no need kind care to show;</div>
  <div class="verse">But, sallow lovers, ye must patient faith still know.</div>
  <div class="verse">Perplexity is ours to bear; ’tis his to own hard heart;</div>
  <div class="verse">Shed he our blood; what sin? He’ll not pay murder’s smart.</div>

  <div class="verse">How, then, to crave a remedy? The evil’s done.</div>
  <div class="verse">Last night, in dream, a warder, from my love’s abode,</div>

</div></div></div>


<h4>90.</h4>

<p>It is related that, after his death, when laid on his bier,
and while he was being washed by the hands of a loving
and beloved disciple, while others poured the water for
the ablution of Jelāl’s body, not one drop was allowed
to fall to the earth. All was caught by the fond ones
around, as had been the case with the Prophet at his
death. Every drop was drunk by them as the holiest and
purest of waters.</p>

<p>As the washer folded Jelāl’s arms over his breast, a
tremor appeared to pass over the corpse, and the washer
fell with his face on the lifeless breast, weeping. He felt
his ear pulled by the dead saint’s hand, as an admonition.
On this, he fainted away, and in his swoon he heard a cry
from heaven, which said to him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> “Ho there! Verily the
saints of the Lord have nothing to fear, neither shall they
sorrow. Believers die not; they merely depart from one
habitation to another abode!”</p>


<h4>91.</h4>

<p>When the corpse was brought forth, all the men, women,
and children, who flocked to the funeral procession, smote
their breasts, rent their garments, and uttered loud lamentations.
These mourners were of all creeds, and of various
nations; Jews and Christians, Turks, Romans, and Arabians
were among them. Each recited sacred passages, according
to their several usages, from the Law, the Psalms, or
the Gospel.</p>

<p>The Muslims strove to drive away these strangers, with
blows of fist, or staff, or sword. They would not be
repelled. A great tumult was the result. The Sultan,
the Heir-Apparent, and the Perwāna all flew to appease
the strife, together with the chief Rabbis, the Bishops,
Abbots, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It was asked of these latter why they mixed themselves
up with the funeral of an eminent Muslim sage and saint.
They replied that they had learnt from him more of the
mysteries shrouded in their scriptures, than they had ever
known before; and had found in him all the signs and
qualities of a prophet and saint, as set forth in those
writings. They further declared: “If you Muslims hold
him to have been the Muhammed of his age, we esteem
him as the Moses, the David, the Jesus of our time; and
we are his disciples, his adherents.”</p>

<p>The Muslim leaders could make no answer. And so, in
all honour, with every possible demonstration of love and
respect, was he borne along, and at length laid in his grave.</p>

<p>He had died as the sun went down, on Sunday, the fifth
of the month Jumāda-l-ākhir, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 672 (16th December
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1273); being thus sixty-eight (lunar) years (sixty-six
solar years) of age.</p>


<h4>92.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled is reported to have related that, shortly
after the death of his father, Jelāl, he was sitting with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
step-mother, Jelāl’s widow, Kirā Khātūn, and Husāmu-’d-Dīn,
when his step-mother saw the spirit of the departed
saint, winged as a seraph, poised over his, Sultan Veled’s,
head, to watch over him.</p>


<h4>93.</h4>

<p>Jelāl had a female disciple, a saint, named Nizāma
Khātūn, an intimate friend of his wife’s.</p>

<p>Nizāma formed the design to give a spiritual party
to Jelāl, with an entertainment for his disciples. She
possessed nothing but a Thevr (<i>or</i> Sevr)<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> veil, which she
had destined to be her own winding-sheet.</p>

<p>She now ordered her servants to sell this veil, and so
procure the necessaries for the projected feast. But, that
same morning, Jelāl came to her house with his disciples,
and, addressing her, said: “Nizāma Khātūn, sell not thy
veil; to thee it is a piece of necessary furniture. Lo! we
are come to thy entertainment.”</p>

<p>He and his disciples remained with her, engaged in
spiritual exercises, three whole days and nights.</p>


<h4>94.</h4>

<p>After Jelāl’s death, Kīgātū Khān, a Mogul general,
came up against Qonya, intending to sack the city and
massacre the inhabitants. (He was emperor from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 690
to 696, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1290-1294.)</p>

<p>That night, in a dream, he saw Jelāl, who seized him
by the throat, and nearly choked him, saying to him:
“Qonya is mine. What seekest thou from its people?”</p>

<p>On awaking from his dream, he fell on his knees and
prayed for mercy, seeking also for information as to what
that portent might signify. He sent in an ambassador to
beg permission for him to enter the city as a friendly
guest.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the palace, the nobles of Qonya<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
flocked to his court with rich offerings. All being seated
in solemn conclave, Kīgātū was suddenly seized with a
violent tremor, and asked one of the princes of the city,
who was seated on a sofa by himself: “Who may the
personage be that is sitting at your side on your sofa?”
The prince looked about, right and left; but saw no one.
He replied accordingly. Kīgātū answered: “What? How
sayest thou? I see by thy side, seated, a tall man with
a grisly beard and a sallow complexion, a grey turban,
and an Indian plaid over his chest, who looks at me most
pryingly.”</p>

<p>The prince sagaciously suspected forthwith that Jelāl’s
shade was there present by his side, and made answer:
“The sacred eyes of majesty alone are privileged to witness
that vision. It is the son of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn of Balkh, our
Lord Jelālu-’d-Dīn, who is entombed in this land.”</p>

<p>The Khān replied: “Last night I saw him in my dream.
He went nigh choking me, and told me Qonya is his
possession. Now, prince, thee I call my adoptive father;
and I entirely forego my intention to devastate this city.
Tell me; has that holy man any son or descendant alive
here?”</p>

<p>The prince told him of Bahā Veled, now Sheykh of the
city, and the peerless saint of God. Kīgātū expressed the
wish to go and visit the Sheykh. The prince conducted
him and his suite of nobles to Sultan Veled. They all
declared themselves his disciples, and assumed the dervish
turban. Bahā recounted to the Khān the history of his
grandfather’s expulsion from Balkh, and of all that followed.
The Khān offered him royal presents, and accompanied
him on a visit of reverence to the shrine of the deceased
saint.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Shemsu-’d-Dīn Tebrīzī, Muhammed son of ‘Alī son of
Melik-dād.</i></p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz was surnamed the Sultan of
Mendicants, the Mystery of God upon earth, the Perfect
in word and deed. Some had styled him the Flier,
because he travelled about so much; and others spoke
of him as the Perfect One of Tebrīz.</p>

<p>He went about seeking for instruction, human and
spiritual. He had visited many of the chief spiritual
teachers of the world; but he had found none equal to
himself. The teachers of all lands became, therefore,
pupils and disciples to him.</p>

<p>He was always in quest of the beloved object of the
soul (God). His corporeal frame he habited in coarsest
felt, shrouding his eminent greatness from all eyes in what
are really the jewelled robes of spirituality.</p>

<p>At Damascus it was, where he was then studying, that
he first saw Jelālu-’d-Dīn by chance in a crowded market-place;
but Jelāl, who was at that time a student also,
avoided him.</p>

<p>Ultimately, he was led to Qonya in Jelāl’s traces, and
first arrived there at dawn, on Saturday, the twenty-sixth
of Jumāda-’l-ākhir, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 642 (28th November, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1244),
Jelāl being then professor at four colleges there. They
met as is related in a former chapter (chap. iii. Nos. 8, 9).</p>

<p>At the end of three months’ seclusion together, passed
in religious, scientific, and spiritual disquisitions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
investigations, Shemsu-’d-Dīn became satisfied that he
had never met Jelāl’s equal.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>When Shemsu-’d-Dīn was quite worn out by a series
of divine manifestations and the consequent ecstasies, he
used to break away, hide himself, and work as a day-labourer
at the water-wheels of the Damascus gardens,
until his equanimity would be restored. Then he would
return to his studies and meditations.</p>

<p>In his supplications to God, he was constantly inquiring
whether there was not in either world, corporeal and
spiritual, one other saint who could bear him company.
In answer thereto, there came at length from the unseen
world the answer, that the one holy man of the whole
universe who could bear him company was the Lord
Jelālu-’d-Dīn of Rome.</p>

<p>On receiving this answer, he set out at once from
Damascus, and went in quest of his object to the land
of Rome (Asia Minor).</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif related that his father, Sultan Veled,
told him that one day, as a trial and test, Shemsu-’d-Dīn
requested Jelāl to make him a present of a slave. Jelāl
instantly went and fetched his own wife, Kirā Khātūn,
who was as extremely beautiful as virtuous and saintlike,
offering her to him.</p>

<p>To this act of renunciation Shemsu-’d-Dīn replied:
“She is my most esteemed sister. What I want is a
youth to wait on me.” Jelāl thereupon produced his own
son, Sultan Veled, who, he said, would be proud to carry
the shoes of Shems, placing them before him for use when
required for a walk abroad. Again Shems objected:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> “He
is as my son. But, perhaps, you will supply me with
some wine. I am accustomed to drink it, and am not
comfortable without it.”</p>

<p>Jelāl now took a pitcher, went himself to the Jews’
ward of the city, and returned with it full of wine, which
he set before Shems.</p>

<p>“I now saw,” continued Sultan Veled in his recital,
“that Shemsu-’d-Dīn, uttering an intense cry, rent his
garment, bowed down to Jelāl’s feet, lost in wondering
admiration at this implicit compliance with the behests of
a teacher, and then said: ‘By the truth of the First, who
had no beginning, the Last, who will have no end, there
never has been, from the commencement of creation, and
there never, until the end of time, will be, in the universe
of substance, a lord and master, heart-captivating and
Muhammed-like, as thou art.’”</p>

<p>He now bowed down again, declared himself a disciple to
Jelāl, and added: “I have tested and tried to the utmost
the patient long-suffering of our Lord; and I have found
his greatness of heart to be totally unlimited by any
bounds.”</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Jelāl is reported to have said: “When Shemsu-’d-Dīn
first came, and I felt a mighty spark of love for him
lighted up in my heart, he took upon himself to command
me in the most despotic and peremptory manner.</p>

<p>“‘Study,’ said he, ‘the writings of thy father.’ For a
while I studied nothing else. ‘Keep silent, and speak to
no one.’ I ceased from all intercourse with my fellows.</p>

<p>“My words were, however, the food of my disciples; my
thoughts were the nectar of my pupils. They hungered and
thirsted. Thence, ill feelings were engendered amongst
them, and a blight fell upon my teacher.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>
<p>“He came to me another day as I was, by his command,
studying the writings of my father. Thrice he
called out to me: ‘Study them not.’ From his sacred
features the effulgence of spiritual wisdom streamed. I
laid down the book, and never since have I opened it.”</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Jelāl is said to have related that Shemsu-’d-Dīn forbade
him to study any more the writings of his father, Bahā
Veled, and that he punctually obeyed the injunction.</p>

<p>But one night he dreamt that he was in company with
a number of friends, who were all studying and discussing
with him those very writings of Bahā Veled.</p>

<p>As he woke from his dream, Shems was entering the
room with a severe look. Addressing Jelāl, he asked:
“How hast thou dared to study that book again?” Jelāl
protested that, since his prohibition, he had never once
opened his father’s works.</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Shems, “there is a study by reading,
and there is also a study by contemplating. Dreams are
but the shadows of our waking thoughts. Hadst thou
not occupied thy thoughts with those writings, thou
wouldst not have dreamt about them.”</p>

<p>“From that time forward,” remarked Jelāl, “I never
again busied myself with my father’s writings, so long as
Shemsu-’d-Dīn remained alive.”</p>


<h4>6.</h4>

<p>Jelāl is related to have informed his disciples that
Shemsu-’d-Dīn was a scholar in every science known to
man, and also a great alchemist; but that he had renounced
them all, to devote himself to the study and
contemplation of the mysteries of divine love.</p>


<h4>7.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn was one day sitting with his disciples,
when the public executioner passed by. Shems remarked
to those around him: “There goes one of God’s saints.”</p>

<p>The disciples knew the man, and told Shems that he
was the common headsman. Shems replied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> “True! In
the exercise of his calling, he put to death a man of God,
whose soul he thus released from the bondage of the body.
As a recompense for this kind act of his, the saint bequeathed
to him his own saintship.”</p>

<p>On the following day the executioner relinquished his
office, vowed repentance, came to Shemsu-’d-Dīn, made his
bow, and professed himself a disciple.</p>


<h4>8.</h4>

<p>Sheykh Husāmu-’d-Dīn was originally a young man
who showed great respect and humility towards Shemsu-’d-Dīn,
to whom he rendered services of every kind.</p>

<p>One day Shems said to him: “Husām, this is not the
way. Religion is a question of money. Give me some
coin, and offer your services to the Lord; so, peradventure,
thou mayest rise in our order.”</p>

<p>Husām at once went forth to his own house, collected
all his own valuables and money, with his wife’s jewels, and
all the provisions of the house, brought them to Shems,
and laid them at his feet. He furthermore sold a vineyard
and country-seat he possessed, bringing their price
also to his teacher, and thanking him for having taught
him a duty, as also for having deigned to accept so insignificant
a trifle from his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, Husām,” said Shems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> “it is to be hoped that, with
God’s grace, and the prayers of the saints, thou wilt henceforth
attain to such a station, as to be the envy of the
most perfect men of God, and be bowed down to by the
<i>Brethren of Sincerity</i>. It is true that God’s saints are not
in want of anything, being independent of both worlds.
But, at the outset, there is no other way to test the sincerity
of one we love, and the affection of a friend, than to
call upon him to sacrifice his worldly possessions. The
next step is, to summon him to give up all that is not his
God. No disciple who wishes to rise, has ever made
progress by following his own devices. Advancement
is earned by rendering service, and by spending in God’s
cause. Every pupil who sacrifices possessions at the
call of his teacher, would also lay down his life, if needs
were. No lover of God can retain both mammon and
religion.”</p>

<p>Shems then restored to Husām the whole of his goods,
keeping back only one piece of silver. Nine times as
much more did he bestow upon Husām from first to last;
and, as the results of all things are in God’s hands, so did
Husām at length become the ruler of God’s saints, and
Jelāl made him the keeper of God’s treasury. He it was
who wrote down the twenty-four thousand six hundred and
sixty couplets contained in the six books of the Mesnevī.</p>


<h4>9.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn left Qonya, at the end of his first visit,
on Thursday, the twenty-first day of the month of Shawwal,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 643 (14th March, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1246), after a stay of
about sixteen months.</p>

<p>He returned to Damascus; and his departure left Jelāl
in a state of great uneasiness and excitement. (Compare
a conflicting date given in No. 13, further on.)</p>


<h4>10.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn was one day at Bagdād, and entered one
of the palaces there. A eunuch who saw him enter, without
being himself visible, made a sign to a slave to go and
drive away the mendicant.</p>

<p>The slave drew his sword, and raised it to strike; but
his arm withered, and fell palsied.</p>

<p>The eunuch then motioned to another slave to execute the
commission; and he, too, became similarly incapacitated.</p>

<p>Shems then went away of himself, and none dared to
pursue him. Two days later, the eunuch died also.</p>


<h4>11.</h4>

<p>Jelāl’s father, Bahā Veled, had a disciple, who, for some
reason, gave offence to Shemsu-’d-Dīn; the latter, in punishment,
inflicted a deafness on both the disciple’s ears.</p>

<p>After a time, Shems pardoned the offender, and restored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
his hearing. But the man bore him a grudge in his heart,
nevertheless. One day, Shems said to him: “Friend, I
have pardoned thee; wherefore art thou still cast down?
Be comforted.” Notwithstanding this, his rancour remained.</p>

<p>One day, however, he met Shems in the midst of a
market. Suddenly, he felt a new faith glow within him,
and he shouted out: “There is no god save God; Shemsu-’d-Dīn
is the apostle of God.”</p>

<p>The market-people, on this, raised a great hubbub, and
wished to kill him. One of them came forward to cut
him down; but Shems uttered so terrific a shout, that the
man at once fell down dead. The rest of the market-people
bowed, and submitted.</p>

<p>Shems now took the disciple by the hand, and led him
away, remarking to him: “My good friend, my name is
Muhammed. Thou shouldest have shouted: ‘Muhammed
is the apostle of God.’ The rabble will not take gold that
is not coined.”</p>


<h4>12.</h4>

<p>One beautiful moonlight night, Jelāl and Shems were
together on the terraced roof of the college, and all the
inhabitants of Qonya were sleeping on their housetops.</p>

<p>Shems remarked: “See all these poor creatures! They
are dead to every sense of their Creator on this beautiful
night of God’s decree. Wilt thou not, Jelāl, of thy infinite
compassion, wake them up, and let them gain a share in
the shower of blessings of this night?”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Jelāl faced toward Mekka, and offered
up this prayer to God: “O Thou Lord of heaven, and of
earth, for the love of Thy servant Shemsu-’d-Dīn, vouchsafe
wakefulness to this people.”</p>

<p>Immediately a black cloud gathered from the unseen
world. Thunders and lightnings burst forth; and so
heavy a rain fell, that all the sleepers, catching up what
clothing they could find, quickly took refuge in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
houses below. Shems smiled at the saintly joke, and was
greatly amused.</p>

<p>When daylight dawned, the disciples gathered round,
numerous as the raindrops of that shower; and Shems
related to them the story, with the following remarks:—</p>

<p>“Hitherto, all the prophets and saints have ever sought
to hide from vulgar eyes the miraculous powers they have
possessed, so that none should be aware of the fact. But
now, our Lord and Master, Jelāl, has been so successful in
secretly following up the path of mystic love, that his
miraculous powers have hitherto escaped the searching
eyes of even the chiefest of God’s elect, even as it hath
been said: ‘Verily, God hath saints of whom no man
knoweth.’”</p>


<h4>13.</h4>

<p>Kimiyā Khātūn, the wife of Shemsu-’d-Dīn, was a very
beautiful, and also a very virtuous, woman. One day,
however, it so happened that, without his permission or
knowledge, the grandmother of Sultan Veled, and her
attendant ladies, took Kimiyā with them for an outing to
the vineyards of the city.</p>

<p>As chance would have it, Shems came home while she
was still away. He asked for her, and was informed where
she had gone, and with whom. He was exceedingly annoyed
at her absence.</p>

<p>Kimiyā had scarcely returned home, ere she began to
feel unwell. Her limbs stiffened like dry firewood, and
became motionless. She continued screaming and moaning
for three days, and then gave up the ghost, in the month
of Sha’bān, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 644. (December, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1246. But compare
a conflicting date given in No. 9, further back.)</p>


<h4>14.</h4>

<p>It is related that, a second time, Shems and Jelāl shut
themselves up for a whole six months in Jelāl’s room at
the college, without partaking of meat or drink, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>out
the entrance of a single individual to interrupt them,
or either of them coming forth, Sultan Veled and one other
disciple alone excepted.</p>


<h4>15.</h4>

<p>Shemsu-’d-Dīn was extremely bitter in his preachings
and lectures to the learned auditory who used to gather
around him in Qonya. He likened them to oxen and
asses. He reproached them with being further than ever
astray from the path of living love, and taxed them with
the presumption of supposing themselves the equals of
Bāyezīd of Bestām.</p>

<p>He once went to Erzen-of-Rome (Erzrūm), the prince of
which city had a son so extremely stupid, though very
handsome, that he could be taught nothing, or next thereto.</p>

<p>Shems let no one know who or what he was; but opened
a school for children. Inquiries were made by the prince,
and Shems undertook to instruct the child, and enable
him, in one month, to recite the whole Qur’ān by heart.</p>

<p>He kept his promise. The young prince acquired,
further, during the same period, a beautiful handwriting,
and sundry other accomplishments.</p>

<p>It began to be suspected, now, that he was a saint in
disguise. He therefore quietly slipped away from that city.</p>


<h4>16.</h4>

<p>There is a tradition that Jelāl one day called his son
Sultan Veled, gave him a large sum of money, and bade
him go, with a suite of the disciples, to Damascus, and
request Shems to return to Qonya.</p>

<p>Jelāl told his son that he would find Shems in a certain
inn, playing at backgammon with a young Firengī
(European, Frank), also one of God’s saints. Sultan
Veled went, found Shems exactly so occupied, and brought
him back to Qonya, the Firengī youth returning to his
own country, there to preach Jelāl’s doctrines, as his
vicar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>Sultan Veled walked the whole way from Damascus to
Qonya, at the stirrup-side of Shems, as a groom walks by
the side of a prince’s charger. The whole city went forth
to receive them. Jelāl and Shems embraced each other.
Jelāl became more than ever devoted to his friend; and
his disciples resented his neglect of them, as they had
done before. Not long afterwards, the dolorous event
occurred that terminated the life of Shemsu-’d-Dīn.</p>


<h4>17.</h4>

<p>The Vazīr of Qonya had built a college. On its completion,
he gave a great entertainment, in the college, of
religious music and dancing, all the learned men of the
city being present.</p>

<p>The Qur’ān was first recited in its entirety; after which,
the holy waltzing began. The Vazīr and Shemsu-’d-Dīn
both joined in the dance. Several times they came into
collision; or, the Vazīr’s skirt swept against Shems’s person,
as he observed no caution in his gyrations.</p>

<p>Jelāl expressed great indignation at this want of courtesy
and reverence for his guest and friend. He took
Shems by the hand, to lead him away. The grandees
present essayed to appease him, but their entreaties were
of no avail. The police of the Sultan were therefore sent
for; and when they arrived, they instantly seized Shems,
led him forth a prisoner with every mark of indignity, and
put him to death without further inquiry or formality.</p>


<h4>18.</h4>

<p>Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif related, as informed by his mother,
Fātima Khātūn, that when Shemsu-’d-Dīn was thus made
a martyr, his executioners threw his corpse down a well.</p>

<p>Sultan Veled saw Shems in a dream, and was informed
by him where the body would be found. Sultan Veled
went therefore at midnight with some friends, recovered
the corpse, washed it, and privately buried it in the college
grounds, by the side of the founder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>


<h4>19.</h4>

<p>Forty days after the disappearance of Shemsu-’d-Dīn,
Jelāl, wishing to appease his own sorrow, and quell the
mutinous spirit that had broken out among the disciples,
appointed Husāmu-’d-Dīn his local deputy, and set out
to seek Shems at Damascus for the third time. All the
learned men of Syria became his disciples, and he was
absent about a year, more or less.</p>

<p>The Sultan and the nobles grew impatient at this long
absence, and wrote him an urgent petition, begging him
to return to Qonya. With this request he complied.</p>

<p>Naturally, he had failed to find Shemsu-’d-Dīn in the
flesh at Damascus; but he had found within himself what
was still greater. He went to the lodging of Shems, and
wrote on the door, with red ink: “This is the station of
the beloved one of Elias, on whom be peace!”</p>

<p>It is said that the body of Shemsu-’d-Dīn disappeared,
and that he was buried by the side of Jelāl’s father, Sultan
Bahā Veled the Elder.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Ferīdūn, surnamed Zer-Kūb</i> (<i>Goldbeater</i>).</p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn was originally a fellow-disciple
with Jelāl, as pupils to Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn. He afterwards
became a goldbeater, as his parents were poor.</p>

<p>After a while, when Jelāl’s reputation became great,
Salāh went and paid him his respects. Jelāl knew how
highly Burhān had esteemed Salāh, when his pupil. He
therefore received him in a very friendly manner, and their
intercourse became warmly renewed.</p>

<p>One day, after the murder of Shemsu-’d-Dīn, and the
return of Jelāl from Damascus, he sent for Salāh, and
appointed him his own assistant in the government and
instruction of the disciples, presenting him also to the
king in that capacity.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Jelāl’s first royal protector, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn Keyqubād,
was now dead, and his son, Gayāsu-’d-Dīn Key-Khusrev,
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>The monarch one day made a feast in the vineyards,
and went forth into the fields for a walk, alone. He picked
up a young snake, carried it indoors, placed it in a gold box,
sealed this up, and then rejoined his courtiers.</p>

<p>To those attendants the king exhibited the sealed packet,
as having just then been privately received from the Qaysar<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
of Constantinople with a message to this effect: “If your
religion of Islām be the true faith, some one of your wise
men will be able to see into this packet without breaking
its seals, and to tell what it contains.”</p>

<p>The king then called upon his ministers to prove their
loyalty to him, and their faithfulness to their religion, by
solving this riddle. None of them was able.</p>

<p>The packet was now sent round in succession to all the
eminent teachers and theologians of the city; but none
could unravel the enigma.</p>

<p>At last it was brought to Jelāl, as Sheykh Ferīdūn and
he were sitting together. Jelāl invited Ferīdūn to tell
them the contents of the packet; and he immediately
replied: “It is not a dignified act in the king to imprison
a young snake in a gold box, sealing this up as a packet,
and then tempting his courtiers, ministers, and learned
men with a false pretence. A saint, however, knows not
only the solution of so paltry a trick as this, but is also
aware of every thought in the king’s heart, and every
secret of earth and heaven.”</p>

<p>When this answer was reported to the king, he came to
the college, and professed himself a disciple, remarking:
“If the disciples of Shemsu-’d-Dīn possess such power,
and work such miracles, how great must have been the
sanctity of the murdered martyr.”</p>

<p>Ferīdūn acted for ten years as assistant to Jelāl.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Fātima, the daughter of Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn Ferīdūn,
was married to Sultan Veled, Jelāl’s son. Jelāl used to
teach her to read the Qur’ān and other books.</p>

<p>Jelāl used to call Fātima his <i>right eye</i>; her sister
Hediyya, his <i>left eye</i>; and their mother, Latīfa Khātūn,
<i>the personification of God’s grace</i>.</p>

<p>When Fātima’s marriage was solemnised, all the angels
of heaven were present, and wished the young couple all
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>She was a saint, and continually worked miracles. She
fasted by day and watched by night, tasting food only
once in three days. She was very charitable to the poor,
the orphans, and the widows, distributing to them food
and raiment.</p>

<p>Sheykh Ferīdūn died on New Year’s Day, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 657
(28th December, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1258).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Chelebī Husāmu-’l-Haqqi-wa-’d-Dīn, Hasan, son of Muhammed,
son of Hasan, son of Akhī-Turk,<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> related to Esh-Sheykhu-’l-Mukerrem.</i><a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>On the death of Sheykh Ferīdūn, Chelebī Husāmu-’d-Dīn
was appointed by Jelāl his assistant in place of the deceased
saint. For another ten years these two spiritual
friends worked together in perfect unity as Superior and
Assistant. Husām was surnamed “the Juneyd and the
Bāyezīd<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> of the age,” “the Key of the Treasuries of God’s
throne,” “the Trustee of the Treasures on earth,” and
“God’s next Friend in the World.”</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>Husām once made his obeisance to Jelāl, and related to
him that, when the disciples recited the poetry of the
Mesnevī, and became entranced, he had himself seen a
company of invisible ones, armed with clubs and scimitars,
keeping guard over them. If any one did not listen
to those sacred words with reverence and believing, the
clubs and swords were brought into play, and he was
hurled into the pit of hell-fire. Jelāl confirmed, as being
a fact, all Husām had related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>Husāmu-’d-Dīn was very eloquent, pious, and God-fearing.
He would never use the water, even, of the
college, for drink or for ablutions; but always brought
his water from his own home for those purposes. He
distributed, to the very last farthing, the whole of the
revenues of the college among the disciples.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled and his friends went one day to Husām’s
garden. Some of the disciples felt a desire to eat of some
honey, but had said nothing on the subject. Husām read
their thoughts. He therefore ordered his gardener to
bring some new honeycomb from a certain hive. More,
and more, and still more comb was brought, until all were
satisfied; still, the hive was yet full. When they left his
garden, Husām sent the hive with them; and for a long
time it supplied all their wants.</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>A severe drought afflicted Qonya and its environs.
Prayers for rain were publicly offered without avail.</p>

<p>Recourse was now had to Husāmu-’d-Dīn, who was
begged to intercede for the people, and to pray for rain.</p>

<p>He first went to Jelāl’s tomb, there performed his devotions
to God, and then put up the prayer for rain, his
disciples weeping as they chanted “Amen.”</p>

<p>Clouds now began to collect and lower; shortly after
which an abundance of rain was vouchsafed.</p>


<h4>6.</h4>

<p>Not only were all the revenues of the college, arising
from its endowments, committed by Jelāl to the sole administration
of Husām, but, whatever gifts and contributions
were offered by princes and friends, in money or in
kind, they were all consigned to his care, to augment the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
resources of the general fund. Jelāl’s family, and also his
son, though often pinched, fared as the disciples.</p>


<h4>7.</h4>

<p>The disciples were both surprised and scandalised, at
one time, by Husām’s publicly speaking very much in
praise of certain individuals who bore an extremely bad
character, while he disparaged certain others who were
noted for their pious lives.</p>

<p>They complained to Jelāl; but he confirmed what
Husām had said, and remarked to them: “God looks
only to man’s heart. Those seemingly lewd fellows are
really God-loving saints, while those outwardly pious
livers are merely inward hypocrites.”</p>


<h4>8.</h4>

<p>One day Husām was lecturing. Suddenly he beckoned
to one of the disciples, and told him to go with all speed
to the royal palace, ask to see the queen, give her his
greeting, and say to her: “Instantly quit this apartment
thou art in, if thou wouldest avoid impending destruction,
the result of God’s decree.”</p>

<p>The queen believed his word, and at once removed to
another part of the palace. The apartment was speedily
stripped of its furniture; and scarcely had the last loads
been removed, when, with a loud crash, the building fell
in. Her faith in his miraculous power was thenceforward
increased a hundredfold.</p>


<h4>9.</h4>

<p>A certain Sheykh died at Qonya, who was rector of two
different colleges. The prince who was the trustee of
both, elected to nominate Husāmu-’d-Dīn as rector of one
of them; and a great entertainment was prepared by the
prince for the occasion.</p>

<p>Jelāl was informed of the arrangement, and he expressed
the intention to bear himself Husām’s carpet to his new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
college, and himself spreading it for Husām in his new
seat.</p>

<p>A certain brawler, a kinsman of Husām’s, Akhī Ahmed
by name, was of the company; and he had felt nettled at
Husām’s appointment. He came forward, snatched away
Husām’s carpet, gave it to one of his companions to cast
out of the building, and exclaimed: “We will not suffer
this fellow to be installed here as Sheykh.”</p>

<p>Great confusion ensued. Several nobles of the Akhī
clan, who were present, drew their swords and knives, a
scene of blood appearing to be about to commence.</p>

<p>Jelāl now addressed the crowd, reproaching them for
such behaviour. He told them that their family and
college would not prosper, but that the Mevlevī order,
founded by himself, and his lineal posterity would go on
ever steadily increasing. He then related the following
anecdote:—</p>

<p>“A certain Sheykh from Samarqand, Abū-’l-Lays by
name, went on his travels for about twenty years, with a
view to study, partly at Mekka. At length he set out on
his return home, whither his reputation, as well as numerous
disciples, had preceded him.</p>

<p>“Arrived at the outskirts of his native place, he went
to the riverside to perform an ablution. There he found
a number of women, occupied with laundry work. From
among these, one old woman advanced, looked at him
attentively, and then exclaimed: ‘Why, if here isn’t our
little Abū-’l-Lays come back again! Go quickly, girls,
and carry the news to our family.’</p>

<p>“The Sheykh returned forthwith to his party of fellow-travellers,
and gave orders for their beasts to be at once
reloaded for an immediate return to Damascus. On being
questioned as to his reason for this sudden change of
intention he answered: ‘My people still think of me as
”<i>little Abū-l-Lays</i>,” and will treat me with familiar indignity
accordingly, esteeming me of small account, and
thereby committing a grievous sin; for it is an incumbent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
duty on all to honour the learned and the wise. To respect
them is to show reverence to the apostle of God, and
to revere him is to serve the Creator.’</p>

<p>“Now, the truth was that, when a child, his father had
always called him ‘little Abū-’l-Lays.’ But strangers
would not so understand that term of endearment; they
would think it one of too free and easy familiarity, and as
likely to draw down on the city and its inhabitants the
divine displeasure. It was not consistent with true affection
to allow the possibility of such a visitation to occur.”</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this constructive reprimand,
Jelāl left the college barefoot, and in high dudgeon. The
chief people came after him to intercede, but he would
not be pacified. Their intervention was declined, and he
refused to be reconciled with the broiler, Akhī Ahmed. He
would not consent to go near that offender, who died soon
afterwards; though most of his sons, relatives, and even
his fellow-revellers, became disciples of Jelāl’s.</p>

<p>The Sultan would have caused him to be put to death
at once; but Jelāl would not permit that.</p>

<p>Akhī Ahmed was never again allowed to show himself
at any public reception, and was shunned by all, like the
wandering Jew.</p>

<p>Eventually, Husāmu-’d-Dīn was appointed rector of
both the colleges in question; and Ahmed’s son, Akhī
‘Alī, was a disciple of Sultan Veled.</p>


<h4>10.</h4>

<p>Jelālu-’d-Dīn was of the school of Abū-Hanīfa; but
Husām belonged to that of Shāfi’ī.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> He thought of joining
the Hanefī school, out of deference to his teacher. Jelāl,
however, recommended him to remain what he had
always been, and to strive to inculcate to all the doctrine
of divine love, as set forth by Jelāl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>


<h4>11.</h4>

<p>After Jelāl’s death, his widow, Kirā Khātūn, suggested
to her stepson, Sultan Veled Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, that he ought
to have succeeded his father as Rector of the fraternity,
and not Husām.</p>

<p>Sultan Veled answered that it had been his father’s
bequest that Husām should succeed, that he himself had
sworn the oath of fealty to Husām, and that Husām was
now become a kind of spiritual beehive, through the
incessant and multitudinous visitations of angelic ministers
sent to him with messages from on high.</p>


<h4>12.</h4>

<p>Husāmu-’d-Dīn had a gardener, whose name was Sheykh
Muhammed. About four years after Jelāl’s death, Husām
had reason to reprimand the gardener, who took offence at
this, and went away to another garden, resolved never to
return to Husām’s service.</p>

<p>As he sat reflecting, he fell asleep. In his dreams he
saw Jelāl coming towards him, with an executioner by his
side, who held up an axe. Jelāl ordered the executioner
to cut off Muhammed’s head, as the punishment for his
having offended Husām.</p>

<p>This was done; and Muhammed saw his own head fall
off, and his own blood flow. He knew that he was dead.</p>

<p>After a while he saw Jelāl return, pick up Muhammed’s
decapitated head, place it in proper junction with the
neck of the corpse, and utter the exclamation: “In the
name of God, with God, from God, and to God.” Muhammed
saw himself instantly alive again, felt very penitent,
threw himself at Jelāl’s feet, and cried out piteously.</p>

<p>He now awoke and arose. No one was in sight. All
traces of blood had vanished, and no sign of a wound was
discernible on his neck. In all speed he returned to
Husām’s garden, and resumed his work with alacrity.</p>

<p>But now he saw Husām approaching, who said to him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
“Well, Sheykh Muhammed! Until Jelālu-’d-Dīn chastised
thee, thou wert no Muslim, and wert given over
to stiffneckedness. Had not I interceded for thee, thou
hadst been dead to all eternity, shut out from every hope
of heaven.”</p>

<p>Muhammed protested his sincere repentance, became a
dervish, and professed himself a disciple.</p>


<h4>13.</h4>

<p>When Husāmu-’d-Dīn had faithfully executed for ten
years, as a just and wise steward, all his duties as successor
to Jelālu-’d-Dīn, he one day went, with his companions
and disciples, to visit the shrine of his predecessor.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the mausoleum, information was
brought to him that the gilt crescent surmounting the
cupola had fallen down.</p>

<p>On the moment, Husām felt himself to be stricken. He
asked for an examination of dates to be made, and found
that ten years previously Jelāl had departed this life. He
therefore said to those around him: “Lead me back home.
The time for my dissolution is at hand.”</p>

<p>He was conducted to his chamber, where, a few days
later, on Thursday, the twenty-second of Sha’bān, in the
year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 683 (4th November, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1284), he breathed his
last exactly at the time when the gilt crescent was replaced
over Jelāl’s tomb, and the works brought to a close.</p>


<h4>14.</h4>

<p>Shortly after the death of Husāmu-’d-Dīn, the widow
of Jelāl, Kirā Khātūn, too, departed this life, and was
buried by the side of her husband.</p>

<p>As her corpse was being borne towards its last resting-place,
the procession passed through one of the gates of
the town. Here, the bearers found themselves arrested by
some unseen power, so that they could not move, hand or
foot. This singular effect lasted for about half an hour.</p>

<p>Her stepson, Sultan Veled, with the other mourners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
struck up a hymn, and commenced a holy dance. Soon
after this, the bearers recovered the use of their limbs,
and found themselves able to proceed. All now went well,
and the interment was completed.</p>

<p>That same night, a holy man of the fraternity saw Kirā
Khātūn in heaven near to her husband.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> He inquired
of her concerning the arrestation of the funeral. She
informed him thus: “The day previous, a man and a
woman had been stoned to death at that gate for the sin
of adultery. I took compassion on them, interceded for
their forgiveness, and obtained for them admittance to
paradise. My preoccupation in their cause was the reason
of the delay met with by the funeral procession.”</p>


<h4>15.</h4>

<p>One day, while Jelāl was yet living, Satan appeared in
person to Husāmu-’d-Dīn, and complained bitterly of the
torments inflicted on him by the continuous pious exercises
of Jelāl. He said that such was his deep reverence
for Jelāl and his followers, that he dared not attempt to
seduce one of them; and that, had he known that, of the
seed of Adam, so holy a race of men were to spring, he
never would have tempted the father of mankind. He
further added: “I entertain a hope that the kindness of
heart of his sons will lead them to intercede with Jelāl for
me, and so obtain my eventual release and salvation.”</p>

<p>Husām related this occurrence to Jelāl, who smiled, and
said: “There is reason to hope that he need not despair.
God forbid that he should despair!”</p>


<h4>16.</h4>

<p>Whenever the grandees of Qonya entertained a desire to
have an audience of the Sheykh Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz,
during his lifetime, they used to request Husām to beg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Jelāl to intercede for them with Shems, and so obtain for
them the desired interview.</p>

<p>Jelāl and Husām used to tax those nobles for this favour,
according to their means and circumstances.</p>

<p>On one occasion the Grand Vazīr solicited an audience,
and was taxed at forty thousand pieces of silver; which,
after much chaffering, was reduced to thirty thousand.</p>

<p>At his audience with Shems, the Vazīr was so charmed
with the mysteries revealed to him, that, on his return
therefrom, he voluntarily sent the ten thousand pieces of
silver to Husām, which had been abated from the sum
originally fixed.</p>

<p>These monies were always expended by Husām, as he
saw fit, in relieving the necessities of the holy community,
and the families of Jelāl, the Goldbeater, and their various
dependants.</p>

<p>While Sultan Veled was yet a child, his father, Jelālu-’d-Dīn,
was once discoursing on the miracle of the rod of

<p>The child at once replied: “In a very dark night, if a
lighted taper be brought into a large room or hall, it
instantly devours all the darkness, and yet remains a little
taper.”</p>

<p>Jelāl jumped up from his seat, ran to his son, took the
child to his bosom, kissed him with effusion, and then
said: “May God bless thee, my child! Verily, thou hast
strung a pearl of the very first water on the string of
illustration.”</p>

<p>Sultan Veled’s elder brother, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn, was killed in
the tumult for which the police authorities of Qonya put
to death the Sheykh Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz. Sultan
Veled ruled the dervish community, in room of his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
(after the death of Husāmu-’d-Dīn), for many years (from
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 683 to 712, being twenty-nine lunar years). He composed
three volumes of poetry in couplets, like the Mesnevī
(hence styled <i>Mesneviyāt</i>, Mesnevian Poems), and a volume
(<i>Dīwān</i>) of odes in the Arabian style, arranged in the
alphabetical order of their rhymes.</p>


<h4>3.</h4>

<p>It is related that when Husāmu-’d-Dīn was in his last
illness, Sultan Veled came to visit him. Finding the sickness
was unto death, he began to wail and lament, asking
what would become of himself after the removal of so dear
a friend and so able a director.</p>

<p>Husām collected himself, and, leaning on Sultan Veled,
sat up. He then addressed the latter thus: “Be of good
cheer, and let not thy heart be dismayed through my
departure in the body. In another form, I will ever be
near thee still. Thou shalt never be in need of counsel
from another. In all difficulties and troubles that may
beset thee, I will always be present, and in the visions of
the night will I solve every doubt, and direct thee in each
matter, whether it relate to the spirit and religion, or
whether it pertain to the flesh and mundane affairs. Whenever
thou shalt receive counsel in this manner, know of a
surety that it is I who suggest it to thee&mdash;it will be none
other than I myself. I will show myself to thee in thy
visions; and I will be thy counsel and thy guide.”</p>

<p>Sultan Veled was the first who narrated his dreams in
his poems. Seek them there; there shalt thou find them
consigned.</p>


<h4>4.</h4>

<p>One day a great man asked Sultan Veled whether God
ever speaks to His servant&mdash;man.</p>

<p>This inquirer had frequently had the idea to send an
offering to Sultan Veled; but had hesitated between a gift
of money and one of Indian muslins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>Sultan Veled answered his inquiry thus: “God does
certainly speak to His servants. And as to the method
by which He addresses them, I will relate to thee an
anecdote.”</p>

<p>“There was in Balkh a preacher, who was also one of
God’s most precious saints. He had many disciples, who
loved him dearly. I heard him once say, during one of
his discourses: ‘Long hath God spoken to you in words;
but you will not hearken to Him. This conduct is
strangely improper on the part of obsequious servants.
In God’s name, therefore, I warn you that you ought to
hearken to God’s words, and yield obedience to His commands.’</p>

<p>“Just then, a dervish in the congregation stood up, and
begged that some one would bestow on him a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“A merchant, who was seated in a corner of the mosque,
thrice conceived the resolve to give the dervish a handkerchief;
but thrice he failed to carry that design into
effect.</p>

<p>“That merchant now rose, and, addressing the preacher,
said: ‘Sir, how does God speak to His servants? Pray
explain this, that the method may be known unto us.’</p>

<p>“The preacher answered: ‘For one handkerchief, God
does not speak more than three times!’</p>

<p>“The merchant was petrified. He cried aloud, and
cast himself at the feet of the preacher. What he had
thrice resolved to do, and had not performed, he now
carried out, giving a handkerchief to the dervish, and professing
himself a disciple to the preacher.”</p>

<p>“Now,” added Sultan Veled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> “I say unto thee, O
grandee, do thou also hearken unto the words of God.
Give the Indian handkerchiefs, and distribute also the
money. When thou shalt have hearkened to the words of
God, He will listen also to that which thou mayest say unto
Him. All thou mayest ask of Him, God will give thee;
and whatsoever thou seekest of Him, thou shalt find.”</p>

<p>Forthwith that grandee became a sincere convert and
disciple. Similar miraculous works of Sultan Veled are
beyond all count.</p>


<h4>5.</h4>

<p>Sultan Veled died on Saturday, the tenth day of Rejeb,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 712 (11th November, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1312). He had as many as a
dozen children by his wife Fātima, daughter of the Sheykh
Salāhu-’d-Dīn Ferīdūn, the Goldbeater; but they all died
in infancy, immediately after birth, or ere they were six
months old. At length, on a Monday, the eighth day of
the month of Zū-’l-Qa’da, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 670 (6th May, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1272),
his son and successor, Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif, was born.</p>

<p>Soon after his birth, or when only a few months old,
the Emīr ‘Ārif, at the invitation of his grandfather,
Jelālu-’d-Dīn, and in the hearing of a numerous circle of
assembled friends, thrice pronounced, audibly and distinctly,
God’s great name. His grandfather prophesied
thence that he would be a very great saint, and would sit
in the seat of his own successorship, after his father Sultān
Veled. The Emīr ‘Ārif lived about fifty years, surviving
his father, however, but the short term of eight or nine
summers.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif, Jelālu-’d-Dīn.</i></p>


<p>(Ninety pages of the volume by Eflākī give more than
two hundred anecdotes of the acts and miracles, of various
kinds, of this illustrious grandson of Jelālu-’d-Dīn, the
teacher and friend of the author, who vouches as an eyewitness
for the truth and correctness of some of the narratives.</p>

<p>The Emīr ‘Ārif passed the far greater portion of his
life in travelling about to various cities in central and
eastern Asia Minor, and north-western Persia, countries
then subject to the great Khāns, descendants of Jengīz.
He appears to have been of a more energetic or bellicose
character than his father, and to have ruled with vigour
during his short Rectorship.)</p>


<h4>1.</h4>

<p>On the last day but one of the period of the greater
pilgrimage at Mekka, the eve of the Festival of Sacrifices,
the ninth of the month of Zū-’l-Hijja, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 717 (11th February,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1318), the Emīr ‘Ārif, and the historian Eflākī,
his disciple, were together at Sultāniyya, in the north of
Persia, the new capital of the great western Mogul empire.</p>

<p>They were visiting at the convent of a certain Mevlevī
dervish, named Sheykh Suhrāb,<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> with sundry of the friends
and saints, all of whom were engaged in the study of
different books, at about the hour of midday, excepting
‘Ārif, who was enjoying a <i>siesta</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Suddenly, ‘Ārif raised his head, and gave one of his
loud, awe-inspiring shouts, which caused all present to
tremble. Without a word, however, he again composed
himself to sleep.</p>

<p>When he at length fully roused himself, and finally
woke up from his sleep, Sheykh Eflākī ventured to inquire
what it was that had disturbed him.</p>

<p>He answered: “I had gone in the spirit to pay a visit to
the tomb of my great-grandfather, when there I saw the
two Mevlevī dervishes, Nāsiru-’d-Dīn and Shujā’u-’d-Dīn
Chanāqī, who had seized each other by the collar, and
were engaged in a violent dispute and struggle. I called
out to them to desist; and two men, with one pious
woman, being there present, saw me.”</p>

<p>Eflākī at once made a note of this narrative, putting
down the date and hour of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, ‘Ārif returned to the land of
Rome, and went to the town of Lādik (<i>Laodicæa Combusta</i>,
not far from Qonya); and there they met the above-named
Nāsiru-’d-Dīn. In the presence of all the friends, ‘Ārif
asked Nāsir to relate to them the circumstances of his
quarrel with Shujā‘.</p>

<p>Nāsir replied: “On the eve of the Festival of Sacrifices,
I was standing at the upper end of the mausoleum, when
Shujā’ came there, and committed an unseemly act, for
which I reprehended him. He immediately collared me,
and I him; when suddenly, from the direction of the feet
of the holy Bahā Veled, the voice of ‘Ārif was heard
shouting to us, and made us tremble. In awe thereat,
we immediately embraced each other, and bowed in reverence.
That is all I know of the matter.”</p>

<p>‘Ārif then addressed Eflākī, and said: “Pray relate to
our friends what thou knowest thereof, that they may be
edified.”</p>

<p>Eflākī now produced his memorandum-book, and showed
the entry he had made, with the date. The friends
marvelled at this, and rejoiced exceedingly, their spirits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
being refreshed with an influence from the invisible
world.</p>

<p>‘Ārif then said: “By the soul of my ancestor, I dislike
exceedingly to make a display of any miraculous power.
But, now and then, for the edification of my disciples, such
scenes will slip out. Then Eflākī takes note thereof.”</p>

<p>Such miracles are known by the names of “manifestations,”
and “ekstasis of the spirit.”</p>

<p>When Qonya was reached, three friends, one a lady,
bore testimony to having seen ‘Ārif at the tomb on that
day, and to their having heard him shout.</p>


<h4>2.</h4>

<p>‘Ārif’s last journey was from Lārenda to Aq-Serāy (on
the road to Qonya). In the latter place he remained about
ten days; when, one night, he laid his head on his pillow,
and wept bitterly, continuously moaning and sobbing in
his sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning his friends inquired the cause. He said
he had seen a strange dream. He was seated in a vaulted
chamber, with windows looking on to a garden as beautiful
as paradise, with all kinds of flowering shrubs and fruit-bearing
trees, beneath the shade of which the youths and
maidens of heaven were walking and disporting themselves.
Melodious voices were also heard. In one direction
he noticed a flower-garden, and there he saw his
grandfather, Jelālu-’d-Dīn. He wondered at his appearance;
when lo, Jelāl looked towards him, and beckoned
him to approach. On his drawing near, Jelāl asked him
what had brought him there; and then added: “The time
is come; the end of thy term. Thou must come to me.”</p>

<p>It was from joy and delight at this kind invitation of
his grandfather, that ‘Ārif had wept and sobbed.</p>

<p>He then said: “It is time for me to make my journey
to heaven,&mdash;to drink of the cup of God’s might.”</p>

<p>Two days later, they continued their journey towards
Qonya, and ‘Ārif showed some slight symptoms of indis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>position.
These daily grew more severe. He reached
Qonya. One morning he came out of his house, and
stood in the gateway of his great-grandfather’s mausoleum,
silent, in the midst of his disciples. It was Friday, the
last day of the month of Zū-’l-Qa’da, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 719 (13th
January, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1320).</p>

<p>The orb of the sun rose like a disk of gold, careering
over the azure vault from an impulse given to it by the bat
of God’s decree. It attained the altitude of a lance-length.
‘Ārif contemplated it, and smiled. Shortly afterwards, he
spoke as follows:—</p>

<p>“I am tired of this lower world, and have no wish to
remain beneath the sun, surrounded with dust and misery.
The time is come for me to trample on the stars that
encircle the pole, mounting beyond the sun, to occupy
myself with the mysteries of the heavenly choir, and to be
entirely delivered from the instabilities of this world of
change.”</p>

<p>His disciples burst into tears, and he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is no remedy hereto, but to die. During life,
my pleasure has been to journey and wander about, in
outward space, and in inward self-exploration. For idle
spirits come into the world of material forms to contemplate
the marvels of the horizons, and the wonders of men’s
minds,&mdash;to acquire knowledge, and attain to certainty.
Through the gravity of the body I have been impeded in
the investigation, and I shall not be able to travel again.
Let me, then, wend my way to the future state, for here
below I have no real companion. My only anxiety is, to
be with my father and grandfather. How long shall I be
severed from them in this world of suffering? I long to
behold my grandfather, and I will certainly depart.”</p>

<p>He then cried aloud. After which he slowly returned
to his chamber, and there continued to moan.</p>

<p>He managed to crawl, as well as he could, to the congregational
service of worship of that Friday at noon.
Thence he proceeded to the mausoleum, kissed the shrine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
sang a hymn, performed a holy dance, and uttered ecstatic
cries. He then laid himself down at full length on the
floor, under which he is now buried, and said: “Where
the man falls, there let him be interred. Bury you the
deposit of my corpse in this spot.”</p>

<p>That day was as though the last judgment were at hand.
A tempest arose; all creation, mortal and immortal, seemed
to be groaning.</p>

<p>The day following, Saturday, the traces of his malady
were but too visible in ‘Ārif’s features. He strove to
battle with it, and to converse, as if he were in perfect
health.</p>

<p>His sickness lasted about five and twenty days. On
the twenty-second of Zū-’l-Hijja there was a violent shock
of earthquake.</p>

<p>There was then in Qonya a certain saint, commonly
known as “<i>the Student</i>,” a successor of the legist Ahmed.
In his youth he had made himself a great reputation for
learning, in all its branches. But, for forty years, he had
been paralysed, and had never risen from his seat, summer
or winter. He was well versed in all mysteries, and now
began to say: “They are taking away the lamp of Qonya!
Alas, the world will go to utter confusion! I, too, will
follow after that holy man!”</p>

<p>Shocks followed after shocks of the earthquake; and
‘Ārif exclaimed: “The hour of departure is at hand! See,
the earth yawns for the mouthful it will make of my body.
It shows signs of impatience for its food!”</p>

<p>He then asked: “Look! what birds are these that are
come here?” His eyes remained fixed for a time on the
angelic visions which he now saw. From time to time he
would start, as though about to fly. The assembled disciples,
men and women, wept bitterly. But he again
spoke, and said&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>
<p>“Sheykhs, be not troubled! Even as my descent into
this world was for the regulation of the affairs of your
community, so is my existence of equal advantage to you,
and I will at all times be with you, never absent from
you. Even in the other world will I be with you. Here
below, separation is a thing unavoidable. In the other
world there is union without disrupture, and junction
without a parting. Let me go without a pang. To outward
appearance, I shall be absent; but in truth, I shall
not be away from you. So long as a sword is in its
sheath, it cuts not; but, when it shall be drawn, you shall
see its effects. From this day forward, I dash my fist
through the curtain that veils the invisible world; and
my disciples shall hear the clash of the blows.”</p>

<p>As he spake these words, his eldest son, Shāh-Zāda,
and his own half-brother, Chelebī ‘Ābid, entered the
room. Sheykh Eflākī asked him what commands he had
to give for them. ‘Ārif replied: “They belong to the
Lord, and have no longer a relation to me; He will take
care of them.”</p>

<p>Eflākī now asked: “And what are your wishes with
respect to me, your most humble servant?” The answer
was: “Do thou remain in the service of the mausoleum.
Forsake it not. Go not elsewhere. That which I have
commanded thee to do, as to collecting in writing all the
memoirs of my ancestors and family, that do thou in all
diligence until its completion. So mayest thou be approved
of the Lord, and blessed by His saints.”</p>

<p>All wept.</p>

<p>‘Ārif now recited some verses; pronounced thrice the
holy name of God, with a sigh; recited some more verses;
and then, between the noon and afternoon hours of worship,
having recited two short chapters of the Qur’ān, he departed,
in peace and rejoicing, to the centre of his existence,
on Tuesday, the twenty-fourth day of Zū-’l-Hijja, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 719
(5th February, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1320). Unto God be all glory, now
and for ever!</p>

<p>He was buried on the 25th, where he had himself indicated,
by the side of his grandfather. His half-brother
‘Ābid succeeded him.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Genealogy of Jelālu-’d-Dīn, Rūmī.</i></p>


<p>On his father’s side, the remote ancestor of Jelālu-’d-Dīn,
during Islāmic times, was Abū-Bekr, the dearest and most
faithful friend of Muhammed the Arabian lawgiver, and
his successor in the government of the community of Islām,
as the first of the long line of Caliphs.</p>

<p>Like Muhammed himself, Abū-Bekr was of the tribe of
Quraysh, which claims descent, through Ishmael, from
Abraham, the chosen Friend of God, and Father of the
faithful. The stem of Abū-Bekr’s branch of the tribe
unites with that of Muhammed in Murra, ancestor to
Muhammed in the seventh degree, and to Abū-Bekr in
the sixth.</p>

<p>Abū-Bekr was, furthermore, one of Muhammed’s fathers-in-law,
as his daughter ‘Ā’isha was the Prophet’s only
virgin bride.</p>

<p>A son or grandson of Abū-Bekr is said to have been
among the Arabian conquerors of Khurāsān during the
caliphate of ‘Uthmān (Osmān), about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 25 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 647),
and to have settled at Balkh (the capital of the ancient
Bactria), where his family flourished until after the birth
of Jelālu-’d-Dīn.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>At an uncertain period subsequent to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 491 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1097),
a daughter of one of the Kh’ārezmian kings of Central
Asia was given in marriage to Jelālu-’d-Dīn’s great-great-grandfather,
whose name is either not mentioned by Eflākī,
or I have missed it. She gave birth to Jelāl’s great-grandfather,
Ahmed, surnamed El-Khatībī (as being, apparently,
a son or descendant, or a client, of a public preacher,
Khatīb).</p>

<p>Nothing more is mentioned of Ahmed by Eflākī, than
that he had a son Huseyn, surnamed Jelālu-’d-Dīn, who
married a daughter of a certain Khurrem-Shāh, King of
Khurāsān, and became grandfather, by her, to the author
of the Mesnevī. His son, Muhammed, surnamed Bahā’u-’d-Dīn,
styled Sultānu-’l-‘Ulemā, and commonly known as
Bahā’u-’d-Dīn Veled, or shorter as Bahā Veled, appears
also to have married a lady, by whom he had three children,
a daughter and two sons.</p>

<p>Bahā Veled’s eldest child, his daughter, was married off,
and remained at Balkh, when Bahā Veled, his mother,
and two sons left it, a year or so before it was taken and
devastated by Jengīz Khān in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 608 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1211). His
elder son is not again mentioned by Eflākī after their
departure from Balkh. Neither is the mother of his children
once mentioned. But his own mother, the princess,
was alive, and was still with him in about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1230;
after which, she too is not again mentioned.</p>

<p>Bahā Veled’s youngest child, his most celebrated son
Muhammed, surnamed Jelālu-’d-Dīn, Mevlānā, Khudāvendgār,
and Rūmī, the principal personage of these
memoirs, the founder of the order of the Mevlevī dervishes,
and author of the Mesnevī, had four children, three
boys and a girl, by two wives. His eldest son was killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
in the broil that caused the murder of his father’s friend
Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz. His youngest son is not taken
further notice of; but his daughter was married off to
a local prince, and left Qonya.</p>

<p>His second son, and eventually his successor as Principal
or Abbot of his order, was named Muhammed, and
surnamed Bahā’u-’d-Dīn. He is commonly known as Sultan
Veled.</p>

<p>Sultan Veled had six children, a boy and two girls by
his wife Fātima, daughter of Sheykh Ferīdūn the Goldbeater,
and three boys, of whom two were twins, by two
slave women. The daughters married well, and all his sons,
or three of them, succeeded him as Abbot, one after the
other. The eldest was Mīr ‘Ārif (Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif), the
second was named ‘Ābid, the third Zāhid, and the fourth
Wāhid.</p>

<p>Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif, the eldest, and Eflākī’s patron, had
two sons and a daughter. His eldest son, Emīr ‘Ālim,
surnamed Shāh-zāda, succeeded eventually to the primacy
after his uncles. With him, Eflākī’s memoir is brought
to a close.</p>

<p>Such was the natural line of this dynasty of eminent
men. But Eflākī has also given the links of a spiritual
series, through whom the mysteries of the dervish doctrines
were handed down to and in the line of Jelālu-’d-Dīn.</p>

<p>In the anecdote No. 79, of chapter iii., the account is
given of the manner in which the prophet Muhammed
confided those mysteries to his cousin, son-in-law, and
afterwards his fourth successor, as Caliph, ‘Ālī son of
Abū-Tālib, the “Victorious Lion of God.”</p>

<p>‘Ālī communicated the mysteries to the Imām Hasan
of Basra, who died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 110 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 728); Hasan taught
them to Habīb the Persian,<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> who confided them to Dāwūd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
of the tribe of Tayyi’,&mdash;Et-Tā’ī (mentioned by D’Herbelot,
without a date, as Davud Al Thai; he died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 165,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 781).</p>

<p>Dāwūd transmitted them to Ma’rūf of Kerkh (who died
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 200, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 815); he to Sirrī the merchant of damaged
goods (Es-Saqatī?; died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 253, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 867); and he to
the great Juneyd (who died in about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 297&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 909).
Juneyd’s spiritual pupil was Shiblī (died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 334, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 945);
who taught Abū-‘Amr Muhammed, son of Ibrāhīm Zajjāj
(the Glazier), of Nīshāpūr (who died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 348&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 959);
and his pupil was Abū-Bekr, son of ‘Abdu-’llāh, of Tūs,
the Weaver, who taught Abū-Ahmed (Muhammed son of
Muhammed, El-Gazālī (who died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 504&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1110)),
and he committed those mysteries to Ahmed el-Khatībī,
Jelāl’s great-grandfather, who consigned them to the Imām
Sarakhsī (who died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 571&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1175).</p>

<p>Sarakhsī was the spiritual teacher of Jelāl’s father Bahā
Veled, who taught the Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn Termīzī, the
instructor of Jelāl. He again passed on the tradition to
Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz, the teacher of Jelāl’s son, Sultan
Veled, who himself taught the Emīr ‘Ārif.</p>

<p>At the same time that the mysteries were thus being
gradually transmitted to Jelālu-’d-Dīn and his successors
by these links, they were also being diffused in thousands
of other channels, and are at this day widely diffused over
the world of Islām, which daily boasts of its living saints
and their miracles. These latter are perhaps not less
veracious than those continually blazoned forth by the
Church of Rome, and by its Eastern sisters. We, too, have
our spiritualists. Credulity will never forsake mankind
and prodigies will never be lacking for the credulous to
place faith in. There is much that is human in man, all
the world over.</p>

<h3 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h3>


<p>This is the book of the Rhymed Couplets (Mathnawī,
Mesnevī). It contains the roots of the roots of the roots
of the (one true) Religion (of Islām); and treats of the
discovery of the mysteries of reunion and sure knowledge.
It is the Grand Jurisprudence of God, the most glorious
Law of the Deity, the most manifest Evidence of the
Divine Being. The refulgence thereof “is like that of a
lantern in which is a lamp”<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> that scatters beams more
bright than the morn. It is the paradise of the heart,
with springs and foliage. One of those springs is “the
fount named Salsabīl”<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> by the brethren of this religious
order (of mystical devotees known as the <i>Mevlevī</i> or <i>Dancing
Dervishes</i>); but, by saints and the miraculously endowed,
it is called “the Good Station”<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and “the Best Resting-place.”<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
The just shall eat and drink therein, and the
righteous shall rejoice and be glad thereof. Like the
Egyptian Nile, it is a beverage for the patient, but a
delusion to the people of Pharaoh and to blasphemers;
even as God, whose name be glorified, hath said: “He
misleads therewith many, and He guides therewith many;
but He misleads not therewith (any), save the wicked.”<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iia">ii</span>
It is a comfort to men’s breasts, an expeller of cares. It
is an exposition of the Qur’ān, an amplification of spiritual
aliments, and a dulcifier of the disposition; written “by
the hands of honorable scribes,”<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> who inscribe thereon
the prohibition: “Let none touch it save the purified.”<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
It is (a revelation) “sent down (from on high) by the
Lord of (all) the worlds,<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> which vanity approacheth not
from before, nor from behind,”<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> which God watches over
and observes, He being “the best as a Preserver,”<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and
“the Most Compassionate of the merciful ones,”<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> unto
whom pertain (many) titles, His utmost title being God,
whose name be exalted.</p>

<p>We have been brief in (stating) this little; for a little
is an index to much, and a mouthful may point out a
pond, as a handful may serve as a sample for a whole
threshing-floor, however large.</p>

<p>Thus saith the feeble servant, in need of the mercy of
God, whose name be extolled, Muhammed son of Muhammed
son of Huseyn, of (the city of) Balkh,<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> of whom
may God accept it: “I have exerted myself to enlarge
this book of poetry in rhyming couplets, which contains
strange and rare narratives, beautiful sayings, and recondite
indications, a path for the devout, and a garden for
the pious, short in its expressions, numerous in their
applications. This have I done at the instance of my
lord and master, my trust, and as the soul in my body,
the moral store of my to-day and my morrow, the Sheykh
Hasan son of Muhammed son of Hasan, commonly known
by the appellation of Akhī-Turk (my brother Turk), a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iiia">iii</span>
chief of the knowing ones (Gnostics?), a leader of right
direction and sure knowledge, a helper of the human
race, a confidant of men’s hearts and minds, a charge
of God among His creatures, His pure one among His
reasoning servants, (a compendium of) His commandments
to His Prophet, of His mysteries with His chosen one, a
key to the treasures of the throne, a custodian of the
riches of the extended earth, a man of excellencies, a
sharp sword for the severance of truth and religion
(from falsehood and blasphemy),<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> the Bāyezīd<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> of the
age, the Juneyd<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> of the period, the true friend son
of a true friend son of a true friend, may God be pleased
with him and with them, originally from the town of
Urmiyya,<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and related to the venerated Sheykh,<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> as
he himself expressed it: ‘I was a Kurd one evening, and
was an Arabian in the morning.’<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> May God sanctify his
spirit, and the spirits of his successors! Blessed is such
a predecessor; blessed are such successors! He was
descended from a line on which the sun had cast its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iva" id="Page_iva"></a>[Pg iv]</span>
lustrous mantle, and personal nobility such that the stars
shed their lights around it. May their courtyard ever be
a centre to which the sons of saints will turn, and a temple
of hopes about which embassies of spotless men will circulate.
May it not cease to be thus while a constellation
rises and a sparkling orb appears above the horizon in the
east; so that it may be a thing held to by those who are
possessed of insight, the godly, the spiritual, the heavenly,
the celestial, the men of light, who keep silence and
observe, who are absent though present, who are kings
clothed in rags, the nobles of nations, endowed with
virtues, the lights of guidances. Amen, O Lord of (all)
the worlds. And this is a prayer not to be rejected; for
it is a prayer joined in by all the good. And glory be to
God in His unity. And may God pronounce blessings on
our lord, Muhammed, and on his family and kin, the good,
the clean!”</p>

  <div class="verse">A lion, wolf, and fox together went to hunt;</div>
  <div class="verse">Among the hills, in quest of game, they turned their brunt.</div>
  <div class="verse">By mutual help and aid, they hoped to make the field</div>
  <div class="verse">Too hot for other animals not under union’s shield.</div>
  <div class="verse">Co-operating with each other, they surmised,</div>
  <div class="verse">A heavy bag they each would make of what each prized.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">’Tis true, the noble lion felt of this ashamed.</div>
  <div class="verse">Still, he politely showed towards them his spirit tamed.</div>
  <div class="verse">A king feels inconvenienced by throngs of troops;</div>
  <div class="verse">But out of kindness makes them share his warlike swoops.<span class="linenum">5</span></div>
  <div class="verse">The sun would feel ashamed, did stars with him appear;</div>

  <div class="verse">’Twas God’s command to Ahmed still: “With them consult.”<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></div>
  <div class="verse">True, they gave no advice; no counsel did result.</div>
  <div class="verse">Upon the balance barley’s weighed, as well as gold;</div>
  <div class="verse">But barley, thence, has not acquired gold’s value told.</div>

  <div class="verse">A dog has sometimes charge of palace-yard below.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse">A mountain-ox, an ibex, next a hare, they took;</div>
  <div class="verse">Since fortune smiled on them in each succeeding nook.</div>
  <div class="verse">A lion’s followers on the plain of strife and war,</div>
  <div class="verse">Of food, by day or night, shall know no want, no bar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Their prey they carried from the hills into the plain;</div>
  <div class="verse">Or dead, or sorely wounded;&mdash;bleeding, or clean slain.</div>

  <div class="verse">To see the prey shared out with justice by their sire.<span class="linenum">15</span></div>
  <div class="verse">The shade of their cupidity caught Leo’s eye,</div>
  <div class="verse">He understood their confidence, their longing’s dye.</div>
  <div class="verse">Whoe’er has insight to the hearts and minds of men,</div>

  <div class="verse">The lion, having measured all their secret thought,</div>
  <div class="verse">Made no remark; he knew how they could both be bought;<span class="linenum">20</span></div>
  <div class="verse">Within his breast revolved their fitting punishment:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220a">220</span>
  <div class="verse">“I’ll show you, my fine fellows, what’s by <i>lion</i> meant.</div>

  <div class="verse">His cunning ’tis decides what portrait shall expand.</div>
  <div class="verse">So all your paltry surmise of my royal mind</div>

  <div class="verse">‘They who conceive an evil thing of God’<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> are cursed;</div>

  <div class="verse">To rid the world of scandal, I must end your lives;</div>
  <div class="verse">Your story shall a moral point; whoe’er contrives.”</div>
  <div class="verse">With this he smiled again most grimly on the pair.</div>
  <div class="verse">Trust not a lion’s smile, all ye to live who care.</div>
  <div class="verse">The riches of the world are smiles of Providence;</div>
  <div class="verse">They make men proud, and lead them to their fate prepense.</div>
  <div class="verse">Through poverty and suffering we may escape</div>

  <div class="verse">So shalt thou honour win from all who see thy wit.”</div>
  <div class="verse">The wolf then: “Royal Sir, the mountain-ox is thine.</div>
  <div class="verse">Thou’rt great; the ox is large and fat; let none repine.</div>
  <div class="verse">The ibex is my share. As I, so it’s the mean.</div>
  <div class="verse">And thou, O fox, shalt have the hare. ’Tis not too lean.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The lion interposed: “Wolf! What is this thou’st said?</div>
  <div class="verse">I present; and to talk of ‘thou’ and ‘I,’ so staid!<span class="linenum">35</span></div>

  <div class="verse">In presence of a lion, who’ll soon make him budge?</div>
  <div class="verse">Come hither, ass! Thyself alone it is thou’st sold!”</div>
  <div class="verse">With this he tears the wolf to pieces, all too bold.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">He saw the wolf had not one grain of common sense;</div>
  <div class="verse">So stripped him of his hide, his life, his brain so dense.</div>
  <div class="verse">Then said: “Since sight of me chased not all thought of self</div>
  <div class="verse">From thee, death by my paw was due, thou wretched elf!</div>
  <div class="verse">Thyself thou shouldst have vanquished in my presence dread.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A man once came and gaily knocked at a friend’s door.</div>
  <div class="verse">The other asked: “Who’s there? Is this a threshing-floor?”<span class="linenum">45</span></div>
  <div class="verse">“’Tis I,” said he. “O then thou straight mayest go away.</div>

  <div class="verse">Saw not his friend; so pined with yearning, anxious fear;</div>

  <div class="verse">Then sought the door from whence he’d been repulsed, again.<span class="linenum">50</span></div>

</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Within, the question’s heard: “Who knocks at my street door?”</div>
  <div class="verse">He answered: “Thy own second self;&mdash;though all too poor.”</div>
  <div class="verse">The invitation followed: “Let myself walk in.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222a">222</span>

  <div class="verse">His smallest daily toil,&mdash;a work like pleasure still,—</div>

  <div class="verse">The kings of yore a custom had, so I’ve been told,</div>
  <div class="verse">Of course thou’st heard it;&mdash;must remember it, of old,</div>
  <div class="verse">On their left hand their champions took their usual place;</div>
  <div class="verse">Because the heart is on the left of body’s space.</div>
  <div class="verse">Their chancellor and scribes stood on their right hand all;</div>
  <div class="verse">In that the writer’s art to the right hand doth fall.</div>
  <div class="verse">Before their face the holy teachers stood erect,—</div>
  <div class="verse">The mirrors of the soul;&mdash;than mirror more correct.</div>
  <div class="verse">Their breasts they’ve polished with the acts of thought and praise,</div>
  <div class="verse">That, mirror-like, they catch each image facts may raise.<span class="linenum">5</span></div>
  <div class="verse">Each object born in nature with a lovely mien</div>
  <div class="verse">Should always have a mirror set to catch its sheen.</div>
  <div class="verse">A beauteous face enamoured is with mirror’s glance;</div>
  <div class="verse">Heart’s piety’s the polish best the soul can chance.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A friend of tried sincerity came from afar,</div>
  <div class="verse">And guest became with trusty Joseph;&mdash;free from bar.</div>
  <div class="verse">They had been friends before, in childhood’s artless days;</div>
  <div class="verse">Had leant their elbows on one cushion, in their ways.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">His brethren’s envy and wrong-dealing touched upon,</div>
  <div class="verse">Said Joseph: “’Twas a chain. It bound a lion. ‘Non!<span class="linenum">10</span></div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229a">229</span>
  <div class="verse">Disgrace affects not lions, if with chains they’re bound.</div>
  <div class="verse">With God’s decree I quarrel not;&mdash;it’s always sound.</div>
  <div class="verse">A lion with a chain around his lordly neck,</div>
  <div class="verse">Is still the lord of them who forged the chain as check.”</div>
  <div class="verse">The friend asked: “How wert, in the well, the prison, cast?”</div>
  <div class="verse">Said Joseph: “As the moon in wane and change at last.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">At change, the new moon’s bent in two, a poor weak thing,</div>
  <div class="verse">But ripens to the full apace, night’s matchless king.<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></div>
  <div class="verse">Pearls in a mortar pounded are, by chance, sometimes;</div>
  <div class="verse">Still, they’re esteemed a joy to glad eyes in all climes.<span class="linenum">15</span></div>
  <div class="verse">Then, grains of wheat are cast into the lowly earth;</div>
  <div class="verse">But golden ears thence spring, a source of glee and mirth.</div>
  <div class="verse">These, too, are ground to dust in mill;&mdash;vile as to show;</div>
  <div class="verse">Increased in value, thence, bread it becomes, we know.</div>
  <div class="verse">Again ’tis crushed between the teeth; to chyme it turns,</div>
  <div class="verse">And feeds the mind, the thoughts, the soul;&mdash;in wisdom burns.</div>
  <div class="verse">The soul, in turn, is subject to the stress of love;</div>
  <div class="verse">New miracles, as seen, “the sowers marvel”<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> prove.</div>
  <div class="verse">But truce to these reflections; let us follow now</div>
  <div class="verse">The words of Joseph’s friend. ’Tis worth while these to know.<span class="linenum">20</span></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">That conversation closed, said Joseph to his guest:</div>
  <div class="verse">“What gift, my friend, hast brought in token of thy zest?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To go with empty hands and visit friends long missed,</div>
  <div class="verse">Is like a man who goes to mill without his grist.</div>
  <div class="verse">E’en God will ask His creatures in the judgment day:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230a">230</span>
  <div class="verse">“What offerings have you brought to meet your Maker? Say!</div>
  <div class="verse">‘Alone, and empty-handed? Is it thus you come?</div>

  <div class="verse">What have you brought as timely offerings in your hands?</div>
  <div class="verse">What are the gifts with which you’d grace your new life’s lands?<span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  <div class="verse">Or, was it that you’d no belief in this return?</div>
  <div class="verse">Our promise of this day by you was laughed to scorn?</div>
  <div class="verse">If you denied thus the hope to be My guest,</div>
  <div class="verse">Then dust and ashes wait you in My realm, at best.</div>
  <div class="verse">If you did not deny it, whence your empty hands?</div>
  <div class="verse">How come you to a friend’s gate, scorning just demands?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Put by a little from thy daily meat and drink,</div>

  <div class="verse">So may God grant thee inward light to cheer thy tomb.</div>
  <div class="verse">And when thou ’scapest from dark and narrow prison there,</div>
  <div class="verse">Then mayst thou soar from earth beyond the realms of air.</div>
  <div class="verse">“The spacious land of God” ’tis named in holy writ,<a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></div>
  <div class="verse">The land to which the prophets all have gladly flit.</div>
  <div class="verse">The heart is never lonesome in that vast abode;</div>
  <div class="verse">Its green trees never wither, frosts no leaves corrode.</div>
  <div class="verse">If now thou load thyself with sensual burden’s weight,</div>
  <div class="verse">Fatigued and jaded, faint thou’lt prove beneath their freight.<span class="linenum">35</span></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">In sleep thou bearest no burden; borne thou art, instead.</div>
  <div class="verse">Fatigue is thence recruited;&mdash;strength regains its head.</div>
  <div class="verse">Know then, thy sleep’s a foretaste of what is to come,</div>
  <div class="verse">From the rapt state of saints arriving at their home.</div>
  <div class="verse">The saints were well prefigured by the “Sleepers Seven.”<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></div>
  <div class="verse">“Their sleep,” “their stretchings,” “their awaking,” lead to heaven.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231a">231</span>
  <div class="verse">Without the least exertion on their parts by acts,</div>
  <div class="verse">The “right and left-hand registers” draw them by facts.</div>
  <div class="verse">The “right-hand register” ’s the record of good deeds;<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></div>

  <div class="verse">But both of these abolished are in case of saints.</div>
  <div class="verse">To them such things are but as echo dies and faints.</div>
  <div class="verse">Though good and evil may their echoes round thee peal,</div>
  <div class="verse">The echoing mountain hears them not in the ordeal.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Now Joseph once again inquired: “What offering bringest?”</div>
  <div class="verse">His friend, ashamed of urgent pressing, sighed. Thou singest?</div>
  <div class="verse">Said he: “Full many offerings have I sought and seen;</div>
  <div class="verse">But none was worthy of thee; or I much misween.</div>
  <div class="verse">How could I bring a diamond to its native mine;</div>

  <div class="verse">In it admire thyself; and think of me, when gone.”<span class="linenum">50</span></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The mirror now he drew from underneath his skirt.</div>
  <div class="verse">A mirror is, to beauty, with attractions girt.</div>

  <div class="verse">The splendour of those inspirations filled his soul.</div>

A genealogy is given in the Turkish
preface to my copy of the Mesnevī,
which traces the descent of
Jelālu-’d-Dīn Muhammed from Abū-Bekr
in ten degrees, as follows:—“Jelālu-’d-Dīn,
son of Bahā’u-’d-Dīn,
son of Huseyn, son of Ahmed, son of
Mevdūd, son of Sābit (Thābit), son
of Museyyeb, son of Mutahhar, son
of Hammād, son of ‘Abdu-’r-Rahmān,
son of ‘Abū-Bekr.” Now, Abdu-’r-Rahmān,
the eldest of all the sons
of Abū-Bekr, died and was buried
at Mekka in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 53 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 672), and
Jelālu-’d-Dīn was born at Balkh in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.H.</span> 604 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1207). Between these
two there are nine degrees of descent
given, for a period of 535 years, or
66 years for each life after the birth
of the next link. This alone suffices
to show that the genealogy is not to
be depended on. Supposing the
names given to be true, many other
links must be missing; as many,
probably, as those given.</p></div>

The expression of: “<i>The venerated
Sheykh</i>,” might, perhaps, at first, be
thought to indicate the Caliph Abū-Bekr,
the Sheykh <i>par excellence</i>, as
he and his successor ‘Umer (Omar)
were designated “<i>the two Sheykhs</i>,”
from each being a father-in-law to
Muhammed, whereas the third and
fourth caliphs, ‘Uthmān (Osmān) and
‘Alī, were his sons-in-law. If this
supposition were correct, Jelāl and
Husām would have been descended
from the same remote ancestor. The
commentators, however, I am informed,
name a certain “Seyyid
Abū-’l-Wefā, the Kurd,” as being
intended. Particulars as to his individuality

Musaylama was a prince of Naja,
who gave himself out as a prophet,
and wrote to Muhammed, proposing
that they should divide Arabia between
them. His epistle began:
“Musaylama, the Apostle of God,
to Muhammed, the Apostle of God.”
Muhammed’s answer commenced
with: “Muhammed, the Apostle of
God, to Musaylama the liar.” He
was eventually defeated and slain in
battle, in the eleventh year of the
Hijra after Muhammed’s decease;
when all Arabia submitted to Islām.
He was killed by Wahshi, the Ethiopian
slave who, in the battle of
‘Uhud, had formerly driven the selfsame
javelin through the body of
Hamza, Muhammed’s uncle. Wahshi
lived long after these events, in Syria.
He used to say that, as a pagan, he had
slain one of the best of men, and, as
a Muslim, one of the worst. When
Mekka was taken, he was proscribed;
but he got away safely. Not long
afterwards, he made his submission,
and Muhammed forgave him, as he
did others in analogous circumstances.</p></div>

“Verily, Sa’d is really jealous;
but I am more jealous than he, and
God than I. Out of His jealousy

This Sa’d, son of ‘Ubāda, was a disciple

the faith before the Hijra.

Hātim Tāyī is the proverbial
prince of Arabian generosity. Many
anecdotes are current respecting him.
His full name was Hātim, son of
‘Abdu-’llāh, son of Sa’d, of the tribe
of Tayyi’. For instances of his
generosity, as handed down by tradition
from a time shortly prior to the
promulgation of Islām, see Mr. Clouston’s
“<i>Arabian Poetry for English
Readers</i>,” p. 406; London, 1881;
Trübner &amp; Co., Ludgate Hill. But
Hātim lived and died before the
Caliphs ruled. He, too, was a poet.</p></div>

Commonly, in Islām, eight paradises,
or, properly, eight mansions
of Paradise, are reported, mentioned,
and believed. Baydhāvī, in Qur’ān
ii. 23, gives only seven, and one of
those is wrong. Guided by him, however,
I have corrected this, and verified
the others, besides finding the
eighth. Their names, then, are as
follows:&mdash;1. <i>Jennatu-’l-Khuld</i>, the
Paradise (garden) of Eternal Duration;
2. <i>Jennatu ‘Aden</i>, the Garden
of Eden; 3. <i>Jennatu-’l-Firdaws</i>, the
Garden of Paradise; 4. <i>Jennatu-’l-Me’và</i>,
the Garden of the Abode;
5. <i>Jennatu-’n-Na’īm</i>, the Paradise of
the Pleasantness; 6. <i>Dāru-’s-Selām</i>,
the Home of Security; 7. <i>Dāru-’l-Maqāma</i>,
the House of Sojourn; 8.
<i>’Illiyūn</i>, the Sublime Heights. Baydhāvī
has <i>Dāru-’l-Khuld</i> for <i>Jennatu-’l-Khuld</i>;
but that is one of the names
of Hell, as occurring in Qur’ān xli.
28. There is also a <i>Dāru-l-Qarār</i>,
Home of Permanence, mentioned in
Qur’ān xl. 42; but it applies to Hell
and Heaven, as does the <i>Dāru-’l-Baqā</i>,
Home of Duration, commonly
used, but not found in the Qur’ān.</p></div>

Qur’ān xxxi. 12. <i>Lokman</i>, the
commonly received orthography, is
doubly erroneous; the first vowel
of the name is <i>u</i>, the Italian <i>u</i>,
the French <i>ou</i>, the <i>oo</i> of our words
<i>foot</i>, <i>good</i>, <i>wood</i>; not of <i>coot</i>, <i>moot</i>,
<i>root</i>. Our <i>q</i> is, historically, the only
true representative of the Phoenician
letter that equally gave rise to the
Hebrew ק, to the old Greek Q, to the
Latin Q, and to the Arabic ق; as
may be seen by comparing the letters
in the last element of the Arabian
numeral alphabet, قرشت, with the
Hebrew <i>Koph</i>, <i>Resh</i>, <i>Schin</i>, <i>Tau</i>; with
the Greek Q = 90, Ρ = 100, Σ = 200, Τ
= 300; and with the Latin Q, R, S,
T. The proof is still more conclusive
by comparing, in order, the whole
alphabets, as to positions, names,
shapes, values in sound, and numeral
values.</p></div>

‘Umer swore he would kill Muhammed,
and went to execute his
design. Arrived at the house of
his own sister, who was already a
secret Muslim, he heard chanted the
twentieth chapter of the Qur’ān, and
was immediately converted. He then
went to Muhammed, and publicly
professed the faith.</p></div>

Qur’ān liii. 17. There is a pun
here. The Arabic for “swerved”
and the Persian for “a crow,” are
identical in orthography,—<i>zāg</i>. Muhammed
has been called by other
Persian poets: “The nightingale of
the garden of <i>mà zāg</i>;” which really
means “swerved not,” but may be
rendered: “we, the crows.”</p></div>

These were the Christian Arabs
of Nejrān. They sent an embassy to
Muhammed at Medina. He proposed
to them a trial by invocation of God’s
curse on the liars, their wives, and
children. He uttered it; they shrank,
and accepted submission to him, on
condition of paying tribute.</p></div>
